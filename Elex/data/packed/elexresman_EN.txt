Elex Resource Manager v1.1 by Baltram <baltram-lielb@web.de> (Februar 19th 2018)
------

  This tool makes it possible to access and modify the game data of Elex, which
  is contained in the .pak archives under ELEX\data\packed.
  Supported file types and actions:

    Elex PAK volume : (un)pack .pak     <--> [folder]
    Elex document   :  convert .hdr     <--> .hdrdoc
    Elex image      :  convert .eleximg <--> .dds
    Elex sound      :  convert .elexsnd <--> .mp3 or --> .wav
    Elex dialog     :  convert .elexdlg <--> .mp3 or --> .wav
    Elex template   :  convert .elextpl <--> .elextpldoc
    Elex world      :  convert .elexwrl <--> .elexwrldoc
    Elex sector     :  convert .elexsec <--> .elexsecdoc
    Sector modifi-
    cation file     :  process .elexsecmod
  
  You can use any text editor to view and edit .hdrdoc, .elextpldoc, 
  .elexwrldoc, .elexsecdoc and .elexsecmod files.

  Below are short instructions on how to perform the conversions.
  (For non-interactive use of this tool, see the list of command line parameters 
  at the end of this document.)

Unpacking Elex volumes (.pak)

  Drag the .pak file onto elexresman.exe. A folder will be created (in the same 
  place as the .pak) containing the volume's contents.

Packing Elex volumes (.pak)

  Drag a folder onto elexresman.exe and enter the archive generation of 
  your choice (1-9). A .pak volume will be created (in the same place as the 
  folder) containing the folder's contents.
  The archive generation determines the order in which Elex loads the archives.
  
  Note that no subfolder may contain resources of more than one type 
  (e.g. .eleximg, .elexsnd).
  
Converting Elex documents (.hdr) to .hdrdoc

  Drag the .hdr file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .hdr files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_hdr' batch script.
  
  Tip: You can delete the 'Timestamp' attribute of entries in a .hdrdoc file in
  order to have the entries' time stamps updated upon conversion to .hrd.
  
Converting Elex documents (.hdrdoc) to .hdr

  Drag the .hdrdoc file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .hdrdoc files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_hdrdoc' batch script.

Converting Elex images (.eleximg) to .dds

  Drag the .eleximg file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .eleximg files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_eleximg' batch script.
  
  Note: Some .dds files use BC7 texture compression which many image editors
  cannot handle. To uncompress such a .dds file or a whole folder, drag it onto 
  the batch script 'convert_BC7_to_B8G8R8A8' in the 'dds' folder.
  To see the utilized texture compression of a .dds file, you can drag it onto 
  the batch script 'show_format'.
  These batch scripts require the programs texdiag.exe and texconv.exe to be 
  present in the 'dds' folder. You can download them here:
  https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/releases
  
Converting DDS images to Elex images (.eleximg)

  Drag the .dds file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .dds files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_dds' batch script.
  
  Tip: If you are unsure about texture compression, use DXT1 for opaque textures
  and DXT3/5 for textures with hard/soft transparency.
  
Converting Elex sounds (.elexsnd) to .wav or .mp3

  Drag the .elexsnd file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .elexsnd files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_elexsnd' batch script.
  
  Note: Original .elexsnd files are converted to .wav while custom ones are
  converted to .mp3.
  
Converting MP3 sounds to Elex sounds (.elexsnd)

  Drag the .mp3 file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .mp3 files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_mp3' batch script.
  
Converting Elex dialogs (.elexdlg) to .wav or .mp3

  Drag the .elexdlg file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .elexdlg files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_elexdlg' batch script.
  
  Note: Original .elexdlg files are converted to .wav while custom ones are
  converted to .mp3.
  
Injecting MP3 sounds into Elex dialogs (.elexdlg)

  This requires an existing .elexdlg file to be present in the same folder and
  with the same name as the .mp3 file.
  
  Drag the .mp3 file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .mp3 files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_mp3' batch script.
  
Converting Elex templates (.elextpl) to .elextpldoc

  Drag the .elextpl file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .elextpl files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_elextpl' batch script.

Converting Elex template documents (.elextpldoc) to .elextpl

  Drag the .elextpldoc file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .elextpldoc files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_elextpldoc' batch script.

  Note: When cloning an Elex template, you need to modify both GUIDs in order to
  ensure uniqueness.
  
Converting Elex worlds (.elexwrl) to .elexwrldoc

  Drag the .elexwrl onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .elexwrl files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_elexwrl' batch script.

Converting Elex world documents (.elexwrldoc) to .elexwrl

  Drag the .elexwrldoc file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .elexwrldoc files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_elexwrldoc' batch script.
  
Converting Elex sectors (.elexsec) to .elexsecdoc

  Drag the .elexsec file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .elexsec files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_elexsec' batch script.

Converting Elex sector documents (.elexsecdoc) to .elexsec

  Drag the .elexsecdoc file onto elexresman.exe.
  To convert all .elexsecdoc files in a folder (and subfolders) drag that folder
  onto the 'elexresman_elexsecdoc' batch script.

  Note: When cloning an entity in a sector, you need to modify its GUID in order
  to ensure uniqueness.
  
  Also note: To change the position or rotation of an entity you can insert the
  attributes 'NewPos' (vector) and/or 'NewRot' (euler angles: Yaw, Pitch, Roll)
  just before the 'MatrixLocal' attribute. Example:
  NewPos = (vec -276210.9 42547 -236502.8);
  NewRot = (euler 0 1.570796 0);
  
Processing Elex sector modification files (.elexsecmod)

  Drag the .elexsecmod file onto elexresman.exe.
  The program opens and modifies all sector documents (.elexsecdoc) in the 
  same folder as the .elexsecmod file. It also opens and reads template 
  document files in that folder to obtain the property set data as specified in 
  the .elexsecmod file. Property sets in the sectors are replaced by those from 
  the templates.
  
  .elexsecmod files are text documents that contain one or multiple lines. Each 
  line starts with the GUID or the name of a template (the name must be in 
  quotes). The rest of the line consists of a list of property set names 
  separated by spaces. Example of a two-line .elexsecmod file:
  
  "It_Po_Healing_Small" gCItemConsumable_PS gCInteraction_PS
  {4A09B19E-4A4D-40E8-8929-055D53EC1BB6} gCNPC_PS

Command line parameters:

  --non-interactive                   - Disables prompts 
                                        (such as pressing the enter key)
  --generation [number in range 0-9]  - Specifies the generation when creating 
                                        .pak volumes

Usage:

  elexresman.exe <file or folder> <parameters>
