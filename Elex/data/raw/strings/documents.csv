LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-16_09-28-03_00|My own words were to catch up with me and I was rejected from the Calaan project to make way for someone else. But, by then my little project was done. With my broadcast ready and with powerful enemies, they will try to keep me quiet. I know too much. I will need to go into hiding.\r\nI have prepared for this. My salvation is assured. But, I can no longer bring others with me, the risk is too great\r\nThe blind fanatics at Infinite Skies will all die. Calaan isn't ready. The great rocket designed to take us into the skies to safety would never fly.\r\nI will tell the world what they did, that there was a chance at salvation.

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-04_13-33-59_00|Even if I am not allowed to publicize my results, I fully intend to record the results of my research.\r\nWhat my colleagues and I discovered in these few months is a giant leap forward. I am not allowed to ask questions about the project, but it is senseless that such research is being kept secret.\r\nStill we are paid well and that is enough to not care what we are working for. And the money available here is considerable. I mean, we created a first-class research center from the ground up in months. All our equipment is cutting-edge and the security is extremely tight. It is certain we are participating in something great.\r\nOur greenhouses are the most important element of the facility:\r\nEquipped with their own climate systems, they are completely sealed off from external influences.\r\nWe can expose the plants there to any level of radiation, change the climate and the acidity of both water and soil.\r\nWe have bred many new species there. Some of these plants would not survive in the normal atmosphere. But they provide a new plant diversity that can ensure survival under the harshest conditions.|

That means we could have found a power source.\r\n...\r\nDay 76 after the impact\r\nAnd the politicians amongst us have already managed to sell it to the people.\r\nWe have called it Elex\r\nThey have withheld its negative effects.

LETTER_WEIDMANNFX8_2016-06-27_12-46-23_00|The first day after my exile\r\nEven if we were exiled, entirely unjustly, it was still a blessing in disguise. We were offered rehabilitation under good guidance, if you can call it that.\r\nWe are caring for the World Heart here and hope to prove that we are worthy of returning to Goliet.\r\nI decided to keep this journal so that I have proof of our commitment.\r\nI am counting the days until I can leave this valley.\r\nWe will make a success of this.\r\nSecond day after my exile:\r\nThe work is exhausting. As soon as you scratch out a groove on the Heart, it clots. We have a lot to learn about caring for it.\r\nThird day after my exile:\r\nSkald is making trouble. He claims he is the only one working here. I don't know why he feels such a victim.\r\nFourth day after my exile:\r\nThis morning Skald announced to everyone that he is giving up on work. He downed tools and walked off. Four days, that's all it's taken him to give up. And our sentence is for years!\r\nFifth day after my exile:\r\nI heard whispering tonight. I was too tired to look for where it was coming from.\r\nFifth day after my exile:\r\nSHIT! I should have looked around. Mana went missing during the night. Skald is beside himself with anger. He has been yelling for 20 minutes now.\r\nBut he is right, if we can't find out who is responsible then none of us are going home early.\r\nWe might all die here because of this...\r\nEighth day after my exile:\r\nA few things have happened in the last few days. Skald accused someone and locked him away. He is watching him now. Yes, I admit he didn't have an alibi, but I just can't picture him stealing the Mana. \r\nTenth day after my exile:\r\nI hear the whispering every night now. I even went looking in case it would reveal the real Mana thief.\r\nBut I couldn't find anybody. The voices seemed to be coming from the World Heart itself.\r\nWhat is going on here?\r\nAm I going crazy?\r\nEleventh night after my exile:\r\nSomething is wrong here. Whispers at night, more and more things are going missing, and now... \r\nI hear sounds out there. I don't dare go out.\r\nIt is starting to dawn on me... I don't think we are alone and I don't think we are going to survive another month here.\r\nI am afraid to sleep...|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2015-09-29_12-20-18_00|Hot winds struck him in the face, the blazing heat of the volcano. He did not tremble upon seeing it, nor at the sight of the towering, steel colossi that guarded it. They had never been defeated and the Clerics had them to thank for their power. After the fall of the Old World, the Clerics used these machines to enforce the laws of their cruel god.\r\n But on this day, Erik Eisenfaust showed the power of Mana. Alone, abandoned by his comrades who had fled or fallen, Erik engaged the Colossi in battle.\r\n But the human spirit becomes strong in dark times. As the battle raged, Eisenfaust's body began to change. His skin became impervious to their weapons, his sword pierced all armor. Even those metal machines were no match for his power. The Colossi fell before him and the Clerics learned the power of Berserker magic.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2015-12-11_08-16-29_00|History is important, it tells us who we are. So, I am writing down this summary so our efforts and our ancestors aren't forgotten.\r\nI am writing this down so that people know how our world came to be what it is now.\r\nThe Comet caused huge damage. It destroyed our cities, our economy, our states. Only a very small percentage of our population survived. Everything they knew was destroyed, their technology powerless. They had become dependent on their way of life, now they needed to learn a whole new set of skills to survive.\r\nThey had to learn how to survive without any tools. So, came the first settlers who would become Berserkers. They avoided Elex, that corrupting substance that came with the Comet. To achieve this they set up a settlement called Goliet in Edan, an area where plants had survived, sheltered by the mountains from the worst of Elex pollution. To protect themselves, they built fortifications and grew their population by offering shelter to any survivors.\r\nAs their community grew, they discovered that living together would only work if they designed an ordered society.\r\nThe founder of this law, was Amrek, the first Warlord of the Berserkers. His father had been a co-founder of the first settlement and he had grown up learning the Berserker way. It was Amrek who put the Berserkers onto the correct path, a path to make the land usable again, to make a world where we can all provide for ourselves. A world regrown from the ashes of the past.|

LETTER_GARTMANNI3_2017-03-02_13-15-43_00|If you are reading this, I am probably long gone.\r\nI have had a keen interest in the comet for as long as I can remember. It brought so much destruction, but it also brought immeasurable power in the form of Elex. It is a symbol of death and resurrection.\r\nFor many years, I studied the impact the comet strike had on the environs and how far its larger and smaller parts were scattered across the land. During my search for parts of the comet core, I recorded huge Elex deposits. According to previous research, the core supposedly has a very specific density and possesses certain remarkable powers. Although I did not dare venture into the crater – the poisonous gas and the radiation are lethal the further down you go – I eventually found a piece of the comet core during my travels.\r\nI had this special gift sealed and attached to a chain before I stored it away in its hiding place. Only the one who has been retracing my steps and knows to appreciate the unique properties of the core shall be able to use it to their advantage. \r\nGood luck, stranger.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-16_08-17-00_00|I have discovered that our people conducted experiments with Elex in the past. There are isolated texts about it. These must be kept confidential. It's also clear that my research must remain secret. My brothers and sisters would not understand my aims. They are blinded by their belief.\r\nI can see that Elex is a very special power. We only use it as an energy source for machines, but I believe people can also be improved by Elex.\r\nIt's just that no one has dared to test the limits of Elex until now. There are records of cases where Elex did not lead to the degeneration of the subject.\r\nThe research shows degeneration depends on strength of will. Mental strength determines what Elex does to a person. Elex can give a person power if they are strong enough. I believe I am.\r\n...\r\nMy experiments are progressing well.

Our native fauna has evolved rapidly and, whilst many creatures have become more aggressive, it appears they are also more open to suggestion and mind control. It is necessary to implant control devices, but that provides the opportunity to turn them into fighting machines.\r\nThese mutants have instincts for hunting, tracking, and combat, that would take decades of research to replicate with AI.

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2015-10-30_11-45-31_00|...\r\nSmuggling is getting more dangerous with every trip and this canyon is giving me more to worry about than it should. I am curious about what Edan will look like, I have heard so much about it. It's supposed to be very fertile and beautiful.\r\n...\r\nI have crossed the border into Edan and this country is so green! The land is free, but the people seem so alien and their Mana gives them powerful magic.\r\nBut the Berserkers are bound up in strict laws and hate technology.\r\n...\r\nThose who cross them are sent to the Valley of the Damned. I should go there to see the red trees with my own eyes, and the ghosts, if those stories are true.\r\n...|

We came here to do a job, to change this place, to bring warmth and life to this desert of ice. The World Hearts had been so successful, we couldn't see failure as possible.\r\nBut only one of the Seedlings survived the journey here. And, though we found a seam of Elex here that helped it thrive, it wasn't long after we set up our camp that the Albs came... The power they get from Elex is terrifying. Even our most experienced Warriors were hardly a match for them. I barely got away. We came here to bring life. Instead we go, leaving only death.|

Nobody will hear about us, if we kill everyone that finds us.|
LETTER_IKENI7_2016-06-16_09-56-57_00|Elex is useful as a commodity and as a resource. However, these very qualities mean it is usually well guarded. For our organization to go unnoticed we can't acquire Elex through violence. Fortunately, we have learned that Logan, the Duke of Tavar, keeps a stash of Elex. We know that one of Baxter's people stole a recording of the Duke that had the code on it. We have lost track of this individual and need to locate him.\r\nSomeone needs to find the thief who stole the Duke's notes, take the code to the Fort in Tavar and find the chest that the code opens. We are only interested in the Elex. You can keep whatever else you find in there. \r\nReward: 900 shards\r\nRisks: The thief is one of Baxter's people. If he is still alive, he is unlikely to give up the code without a fight. Finding the chest shouldn't be too difficult, but it will have to be done without alerting the Duke's people. It will reveal its treasures with the right code.\r\n|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-16_09-20-47_00|The problem was common. If the Comet hit our world, all who were still on the planet were likely to perish. So, only those that could leave it would be certain to survive. We lacked the capacity to lift all but a very small number of people and then only as far as orbit. so, we would need to select those who would reach the skies. Those who were chosen would survive.\r\nIn strict secrecy, suitable candidates were sought using an advertising campaign. With a weighting towards younger applicants, the clear requirement for the project was genetic superiority. The fit, the healthy, the intelligent.\r\nThe PR people at Infinite Skies did a lot of work. Many different citizens applied and were put through a rigorous filtering process to find those best suited to continue our species.\r\nThe catastrophe meant a process of natural selection that we could control.

LETTER_IKENI7_2015-03-20_11-32-14_00|Making progress into the mine meant using explosives. After we blew a path through the blocked tunnel, we had to repair some of the support beams and secure the roof against further collapse. \r\nThis progress wasn't without loss Bicks and Manny messed up when they were laying charges. I told the others to get the Berserkers to take the risks in future. We are going to make this work. \r\nBB.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-01-27_08-18-46_00|We had another big fight today. As always, it started over something insignificant. We just live side by side, not together.\r\nI feel like he deliberately misunderstands me. It's as if we are two strangers who just happen to live under the same roof. \r\nHe doesn't tell me anything. He explodes over the most trivial things. I feel like I am running into walls.\r\nWe lost something. I don't know when and where, but it is gone and it won't come back. It hurts me most of all when I realize... I have already given up on us.\r\n\r\n...There was something about a Comet on the radio today. We ate breakfast together at the table and listened.\r\nOur problems suddenly seem...small.\r\n...\r\n People are fleeing and we... We are sitting here and talking about relationship problems... Crazy.\r\n...\r\nThe Comet was supposed to have struck yesterday, but nothing has happened. Maybe the scientists were wrong? |

LETTER_IKENI7_2016-01-07_10-31-11_00|Day 1 of my exile:\r\nHere I am in the Valley of the Damned. And all because of that asshole. I hope his sister is dead when I am released from exile. Otherwise I will have to kill her myself. If I can live long enough. I am not sure how I am supposed to survive here.\r\nFirst question, where to spend the night. I need to avoid the logging camp, so maybe I will try the ruins.\r\nDay 2 of exile:\r\nI met a few other exiles. I had to kill two of them then the rest left me alone. Shit. What am I doing here surrounded by criminals?!\r\nDay 5 of exile:\r\nThe exiles I live alongside have organized themselves well. Some hunt game during the day while the others get rid of the predators in the area.\r\nI have to keep watch tonight.\r\nSeveral weeks after my exile:\r\nI have stopped counting the days. They don't seem to matter any more. Reaching nightfall is a victory.\r\nSomething happened during the night. A troll made the ruins its home. That will be a real problem.\r\nNone of the exiles can defeat him, not with our weapons.\r\nDay 2 after the arrival of the troll:\r\nThe exiles are telling themselves horror stories about the troll.\r\nThey seem to blame it for the mutations in the area.\r\nDay 8 after the arrival of the troll:\r\nSome of the exiles have disappeared. They must have left in the middle of the night. Perhaps the troll has driven them to escape?\r\nDay 9 after the arrival of the troll:\r\nIt seems like the troll knows there are people here. He is leaving the ruins to search\r\nDay 10:\r\nWhat does this troll want? It's almost as if he is observing us. Or hunting us. I hear sounds at night and more exiles have disappeared. \r\nI definitely won't sleep well tonight. We'll see what tomorrow brings, maybe I should go down there and inspect the area. |

LETTER_WEIDMANNI5_2016-10-26_11-35-35_00|We are giving the rock from the Comet a code name. From now on it will be referred to as 'Blue'.\r\nThe commander is complaining that we are extracting too little of it from the Comet ore he's bringing in.\r\nThe problem is just that there are only miniscule amounts of blue in the remnants. It's almost as if it migrates, seeping out of the rocks into the ground.\r\nWe know it is migrating, as while the concentrations in the Comet ore is reducing, the amounts detected in the surrounding ground is increasing everywhere. It's in the ground, it's the food we're eating, the air we breathe, it's everywhere.\r\n Whatever the science shows that won't satisfy the commander. He wants us to locate and concentrate more blue and he wants results fast.|

I might need this information again someday.\r\nDay 1:\r\nI freed Grimar from the Converter. He is hardly able to talk.\r\nI can hardly recognize him, but I KNOW that it is my brother.\r\nDay 2:\r\nHe was able to say a few things and I tried to give him something to eat.\r\nHe vomited everything. It looks like he is getting worse.\r\nI couldn't sleep last night.\r\nDay 3:\r\nI am desperate. He doesn't eat or drink anything. All he does is moan and give the impression that he's dying.\r\nI wasn't able to sleep again. Someone has to take care of Grimar.\r\nDay 4:\r\nI slept in.\r\nGrimar is still there but it looks like he tried to eat my Elexit shards. His mouth is all torn up from the sharp edges.\r\nBut he seems to be doing better.\r\nDay 7?:\r\nI managed to smuggle some Elex out of Goliet. Grimar went for it right away. What I brought doesn't seem to have been enough.\r\nThe days are starting to run together. It is always dark, but I can't sleep.\r\n\r\nDay 8:\r\nHe said something! He talked!\r\nI couldn't understand it exactly and it took hours, but it seems like he wanted to tell me something about what happened to him.\r\nIf I understood him correctly, he seems to have spent some time around the Converter before I found him there.\r\nHe had started to feed on Elex. There wasn't anything else there.\r\nDay 12 or 13:\r\nHe doesn't speak anymore.\r\nThe more Elex I gave him, the more he wants. I have to steal more and more from Goliet. I am afraid that I could get caught soon.\r\nDay 15 ???:\r\nSomeone was here. Someone from Goliet. They found me. They noticed the missing Elex.\r\nThe man told me that he couldn't give us up. I can't thank him enough.\r\nDay ? (Did a day even pass?):\r\nThere is something wrong with Grimar.\r\nI gave him a little more Elexit also managed to buy some more Elex.\r\nHe seems to be upset about something.\r\n??? It feels like an eternity:\r\nHe is not upset, he is just furious now. I don't know what to do. I tried to calm him down but it wouldn't work.\r\nI have to think about what will happen if he gets even more aggressive.\r\nI will try to shackle him...\r\nThe next few nights will be difficult.\r\n\r\nI am tired, but I must go on.|

The ground shook almost without pause. The air is thick with dust and ash. Wet cloth on the mouth barely stops me breathing it in.\r\n\r\n2nd day after the impact.\r\nI am dog-tired. But now is not the time to sleep. We have done what we can for people. No we need food, water. I will go to the gas station and see if there are still supplies there.\r\n\r\nThe gas station was cleaned out. I found a few cans not far from a body. They must have dropped them when they were shot. We're hearing shots now. People are already desperate. I think we need a weapon.\r\n\r\n2nd night after the impact.\r\nThe quakes do not stop. I am sitting outside what remains of our house as it sinks lower and lower into the ground and all I can think is that we still haven't paid it off.\r\n\r\n3rd day after the impact.\r\nWe try to save what there is.

As we grew in strength and gathered stores, we became a target for others including a faction that called themselves Outlaws.\r\nFrom the north, the followers of Calaan appeared. Until then, there had been only rumors of their existence, but now they returned armed with technology that had evolved since the fall of the Old World. For the first time, voices rose up, clamoring for a return to the technology of the past. Some Berserkers wanted to use the Elex to defend themselves.\r\nAs the fighting increased, the cost in blood began to bring all sides to their senses and the factions created the Great Council of Magalan. As the sides designed a peace agreement, the fighting subsided, but suspicion remained.\r\nOur community was able to agree to a peace with the other factions. Of all the factions, the Berserkers had made the best of the great catastrophe and founded a community that aims to give the people a common, but good, life.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2015-12-11_08-59-42_00|Peace was shattered with the coming of the Albs. At first there were just rumors, stories of a split during which key Clerics left Ignadon to found a new faction. Setting up base in Xacor, the Albs began their quest to conquer Magalan to acquire all the Elex from across the world.\r\nThe added pressure on each faction pushed them back into conflict. We had already found ways to make the land fertile again. Against the Alb threat we had our Mana and our magic. We had our World Hearts that revive the land.\r\nSo, in the face of this opposition, the three great Warlords that ruled Goliet decided to renew the Laws. These Laws secure our survival and sit at the core of our society. No matter the threat, no matter the fears, these Laws will keep us strong enough to pursue our plan of making all of Magalan bloom again.|

They are for Miss Daisy and he also gave me a small card.\r\nShe is definitely his lover. She isn't any prettier than I am, and constantly miserable, but men flock to her. I threw the flowers in the garbage.\r\nIt's all so unreal.\r\nThe last few days have been a nightmare. There is nobody who can stop this nonsense. Mr. Kingston locked himself in the bar with some other men. They completely cleaned the place out.\r\nThe shouting and fighting started a few hours later and I hid myself in an empty room. Nobody knows what is going on out there.\r\nThey say we're in the best place if anything happens, but I'm not sure, it feels very remote here and people are already taking the law into their own hands.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2015-12-22_10-25-08_00|I saw an interesting man this morning when I was going about my business. I didn't dare speak to him, but instead watched him trade from a distance. All things that were strange to me, items from a world I haven't seen.\r\n...\r\nWhen he saw me, he spoke. He said he could see my curiosity. He knew that I wanted to discover more of Magalan.\r\nWhen he asked if I would accompany him... How was I supposed to say no?\r\nNow we explore these lands together and my eyes have been opened.\r\n...\r\nThere are two worlds, ours and the one that came before. In those ruins, these houses of times now lost, there is everything you could want. Always shards to be earned.\r\nEveryone lived in such luxury before the Great Fall. They didn't have to worry about Reavers, or mutants. Now we always travel in fear.\r\n...\r\nBut I do not doubt him. He says he has 'a good nose' and he always navigates us through the wilds to the best spots to explore.\r\n...\r\n So, we came to that nice house. I thought we would leave with riches, but we were discovered by a group of Berserkers. They took everything from us since it could contain Elex. Their land, their rules. So, we go hungry for now and must try again. But I trust in him. We trust each other. We will find the things we need in this old world and we will make our way into this one.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2015-09-29_12-18-23_00|My grandfather used to like telling me about the world before we discovered Mana. Edan was a barren place and the sparse vegetation there had to fight to survive.\r\nEdan, as we know it today, only began to bloom with the advent of the Seedlings and Mana. Where Elex brings death, Mana supports life.\r\nThat is why our work here is so important. If we ever lose courage, all we have to do is look at the land beyond. The whole world should blossom like Edan.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-19_09-36-08_00|The Comet has interested me for as long as I could think. It brought both destruction and it brought power in the form of Elex. Devastation and rebirth.\r\nI conducted research around its impact site and charted the consequences this had on the immediate surroundings. Ignadon is a barren land that was transformed into a lava desert by the impact. Everyone avoids the Crater. Poisonous gases and radiation collect there.\r\nSo, these dangers have stopped people looking for the core of the Comet, or at least the residue that remains.\r\nIs it still there?\r\nIn my plans to search for it I have developed a suit based on research from the Old World. It will resist the adverse conditions inside the Crater.\r\nAfter several satisfactory tests my prototype was ready. Entering the Crater was a slow and dangerous operation. Constantly alert for alarms.\r\nThere at the bottom of the Crater I found a heavy chunk of an unknown substance enriched with Elex. I was able to take it with me in an isolation bag.\r\nMaking a find like this has made my dreams come true. \r\nI am keeping it here carefully because I do not know what long-term effects carrying it around with me could have. Besides, this is my treasure and I shall keep it close.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-16_08-05-00_00|Since our brothers and sisters are always faced by the temptation of rumor, allow me to explain once and for all how Erik Eisenfaust defeated our mechs.\r\nIt was at the time that the Berserkers began to improve their powers. They moved to plant their so-called World Hearts not only in Edan, but beyond their borders and into Ignadon.\r\nTo counter this incursion we dispatched units of combat mechs to drive out this incursion. The attack was successful at first, driving out or killing most of their warriors.\r\nThe mechs then confronted this Erik Eisenfaust, but he did not defeat the mechs with the power of their Mana, as the Berserkers claim. Instead it was a common failure of their power supplies. Eisenfaust is not to be celebrated as a hero. That is merely propaganda.\r\nDo not believe in the power of their magic, it is vastly overstated.|

But still some of us survived. We saw the end of the world and now we are to treat those survivors as stupid children?\r\nI can see that I am fighting a losing battle. People are too easy to manipulate. Give them the illusion of hope and they grab it blindly. But I have not forgotten.\r\nI will make sure that the people who come after know what Calaan really is. I will leave the clues for them to find.\r\nI will leave the clues to open the secret door for someone intelligent enough to unravel my riddle. Arvid can silence me today, but one day, they shall learn the truth.\r\nI am broken. Arvid sent his bloodhounds after me, people who are already convinced they are serving a God and not worshipping a machine, but they will not keep me from my task.\r\nArvid will win this day. I cannot show all of these blind people the truth.\r\nNow, now I will meet my end. They left me here in this place to die a slow death! \r\nIf you are reading this, then I can rest in peace.

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-16_09-22-20_00|But, the idea quickly began to lose the logical purity that we had envisaged. The Infinite Skies board forced their input into the project. Everyone wanted to save themselves.\r\nMore and more people learned about the project. Fuel, food, air, all critical parameters became impossible problems. We were trying to lift too many people.\r\nI warned them time and time again that the project was becoming too large. The selection process had to remain strict. But none of the people involved accepted the possibility of sacrificing themselves for the greater good. It was plain to see that the designs we had for Calaan would no longer work. It would never take off.\r\nI decided to start my own project. I gathered as much data as I could and began to work in secret. If the Calaan project failed then I could bring our people to a higher level of evolution myself.\r\nWith my knowledge, the few survivors of the catastrophe would become the new future for our species. So, I created the capsule, a sealed vessel intended to keep those inside alive when the Comet hit. They would arise anew with the supplies they needed to live.\r\nAs the day grew nearer, I began to withdraw from the Calaan project more and more. I would reveal the truth to the world and I would select those that were to enter the capsule.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-16_09-15-17_00|I was a leading scientist working on the most important project in Magalan's history. But the work became...meaningless. For there is now a good chance that instead of success I could witness the extinction of our entire species.\r\nI was hired by Infinite Skies to join their new team exploring the opportunities in space travel. My specialism was the movement of deep space objects, far beyond anything we were capable of constructing, but I was given the job and the pay was a convincing argument.\r\nWhilst others were exploring the technology involved in space travel I worked on the detection of deep space objects. That was when we detected the Comet. At first it didn't fit any of our gravitational models.\r\nInstead of orbiting our sun it was heading directly for us. But the board didn't want to hear about it. Bad news was not why they had created our division, we were supposed to sell dreams, not nightmares.\r\n Years after I first detected it, even my incompetent colleagues started to confirm what I had told them.

LETTER_IKENI7_2016-07-08_08-49-51_00|Living among the Free People of the Domed City, I realize how much I detest them. For anything they do, they require payment. It has taken persistence to acquire the few primitive tools I have obtained. This would be easier to overcome if it weren't for the emotions I am suffering. Frustration, anger. Both unproductive and inefficient.\r\nThis city is corrupt. It will take strength to survive here and to further our cause.|

LETTER_PANKRATZI7_2016-10-21_08-38-04_00|I had an important realization yesterday. I regret my crime and would undo so much if I could.\r\nIf we Berserkers want to survive this cursed world, we have to adapt.\r\nWe have found a true path, but that is only the beginning.\r\nWe have grown Edan back to life out of nothing and destruction. And we could be proud.\r\nBut, our success is fragile. It makes our people complacent. It is becoming more difficult to convey to young people the importance of learning to fight with a sword and trust in magic rather than succumb to the temptations of technology.\r\nUnless our work creates a legacy, then it is dead as the Old World...\r\nJust as we plan to regrow all of Magalan, there is a rot set in amongst our roots.\r\nPerhaps, in the end, we will have to admit that the old law has long been outdated and must be updated if we want to keep our society together.\r\nWe must bend before we break, but in that act, we must not lose the spirit that has helped us make this land bloom once more.|

Not only did two of those assholes get injured, but they were spotted by a group of Clerics. If those Calaan worshippers figure out where we have set up camp then we can say goodbye to the Elex that's in this mine.\r\nBB.|

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-16_07-59-31_00|My research into the climate of the Old World has led me to an interesting conclusion - Elex has influenced Magalan's temperature, it has changed our climate.\r\nThe area we know as Xacor was mild, with a climate similar to that of Abessa, before the Comet's impact. However, Magalan's temperature has decreased considerably in the last few decades. The ice landscape that we know in Xacor today is therefore still very young.\r\nThe reason for that has to be Elex. The cooling process has considerably accelerated since the Albs began gathering Elex and concentrating it in Xacor.\r\nWhat else do we not know about Elex?|

My father left those books to me. They are the only thing I have left of him. \r\nThey say they won't let me have access to the Archives until I hand over the books.

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2016-02-17_13-29-00_00|I went out with my best friends today in order to verify the stories.\r\nIt seems the rumors about my great-grandfather are true. The route I found through the mines, his path through the mines, worked. No one else has touched this treasure.\r\nI tasked my guys with extending the mine field. Once that is done, nobody will dispute this treasure with us again. There is so much liquor stored here. We have enough for a lifetime.\r\nI had my guys get rid of some of the bottles on the black market. We can live a damn good life here.\r\nWith this bottled treasure we don't have to cower before the Duke anymore.\r\nI had some of my people take a look at the cave behind the factory. It is really large, big enough for our purposes\r\nWe can set up a camp there. There is enough scrap to fortify the whole thing. First we have to get rid of the Rippers that are in there. |

LETTER_DIRKSI5_2015-12-22_12-00-23_00|Sandy took away my journal. As if taking my words would change my mind. I am not going to keep this in the diner anymore.\r\nA man was there this evening. He could have been my grandfather. He knew a lot about the comet and Infinite Skies. I listened to him for a long time, until Sandy told me he'd fire me without pay.\r\nAs soon as I get the money I am leaving. I don't want to die here. I asked the nice, old man if he would take me, but he said it would be too dangerous...\r\nThat made me think, I should ask more people, I can find a way out instead of just waiting.\r\nThere was a sweet young guy in the diner. He sat at the window for a very long time and kept looking at the motel. He looked like he was waiting on someone. He also asked me if the room next to Mr. Creeper's was occupied.\r\nWhen he left, along with the tip, he gave me a piece of paper.\r\n'Tonight at midnight, when the diner is closed. At the parking lot.'\r\nThis is my ticket out of here. I know it.|
