INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009095|We've had reports of Albs on the roads around there and out along the river by the World Heart.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009094|It could be they've made those ruins their base and are sending out patrols across the area from there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009093|The Albs have been spotted in some abandoned ruins out there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009092|To the west, in the Valley of the Damned.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009091|Hmm, that doesn't fit the reports I have, but...if you say that is where they are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009090|You aren't alone in that view.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009089|Well, I for one don't trust you as far as I can throw you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009088|You'll just have to keep working on convincing me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009087|Does that count for all of us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009086|Once an Alb, always an Alb.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009085|There are definitely those who see us as a novelty. Which is all right as long as they also understand that we are also people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009084|Albs who have freed themselves from the influence of the Elexetors, fascinating.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009083|This isn't our war.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009082|Albs who have become refugees in your own war.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009081|But, there are some who have...grown used to us being here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009080|Some people make that effort more obvious than others.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009079|Tolerate. 'To permit the existence of with the implication that an effort is required to do this'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009078|And that is what I see in this city. A chance to prove ourselves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009077|I understand your mistrust. But, if you don't give us a chance to prove ourselves then how can this war ever end?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009076|If you still take Elex can you ever really be free?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009075|This city offered me protection, I will never betray it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009074|No. I'm never going back. Nyra can say what she wants, but there's no way back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009073|You should leave here. I'm sure that the Albs would take you back if you gave them information about the Dome.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009072|Someone who has already worked so long at a job that people have decided they are better organizing people than doing the actual job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009071|What is a supervisor?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009070|Sure, let's hear it. I'd like to hear it. You want to tell me over drinks sometime, or tell us here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009069|I didn't ask you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009068|I'd rather swallow all the sand in Tavar than listen to her drivel.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009067|Let me think about it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009066|There, shall I tell you then?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009065|My personal quest is to discover more about Magalan and the people who live here. I would like to know more.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009064|As you wish.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009063|A traitor to many causes, or a heroine to all. We should see what she has to say.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009062|Interest at... 0%... Deactivating attention unit...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009061|Calculating interest in human narrative...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009060|I'd be happy to hear her story. Maybe there are lessons in it for us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009059|What would you know?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009058|The Albs would never choose you. I doubt they would even sully their Converter with your miserable carcass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009057|That's because I get out of the way every time I see you coming, Ray.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009056|Paige? It is Paige right? I haven't seen you in a long while.|Recognising her
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009055|No need to be nasty, Nasty. Just bringing the feel of Tavar to the Domed City.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009054|Watch you mouth, Paige, before I stuff your legs into it.|Recognising her
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009053|Pleasant to...are you mentally stable?|Thrown
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009052|Well, it's pleasant to meet you as well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009051|Go on growl again, growl.|Amused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009050|You had better not mean that literally.|Warning
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009049|Yeah, thanks for the advice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009048|Analyzing....no one here is fresh. Would advise alternative sustenance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009047|I didn't mean you, drone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009046|Incorrect statement... My magnesium alloy consists of... Zero percent fresh meat.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009045|Don't worry, I am not looking at you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009044|What did you call us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009043|Do I eat... what are you talking about?|Thrown
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009042|The only fresh meat here is you. Let me ask, do you eat Elex?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009041|You should sell it all. Then everything would distribute itself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009040|I am sure you would do it that way in the desert. It's not what we do here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009039|Save yourself the trouble. Throw everything into a pile and everyone can take what they need.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009038|I can imagine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009037|You have done a good thing here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009036|You've been helping people? Then maybe you can understand what we have built.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009035|It seems I'm not the only one collecting waifs and strays and setting them on the right path.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009034|That's a shame.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009033|No, I still need it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009032|Your drone could be very helpful. Would you sell it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009031|Would you like an analysis of the component elements?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009030|Calculating food consumption... ... ... Approximately 171,000 kilos of food will be required per year with the current population.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009029|Some of our brothers turned away from our oath. They believed the Hort and Ignadon must come before anything else, but what is a cause without conviction?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009028|I would not have expected the Clerics to care so much for others, but you are doing good work here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009027|I am not surprised someone like you thinks that way. That is why we have so many Separatists here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009026|Then don't bother. Those who can't provide for themselves do not deserve to survive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009025|You seem like a reasonable guy, how about we come to sort of arrangement?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009024|Oh, trust me you're safe. I can't think of any Outlaws who'd fuck you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009023|I've been saying the same thing myself, but these Outlaws. You can't trust them, they're always trying to fuck you over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009022|I said it sounds like you need time off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009021|What did you say?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009020|This guy needs to get laid, or jerk off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009019|Then I'd better keep you out for your own protection. You're going to last two seconds if you babble like that to the Outlaws in there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009018|It would be good if you could let us in. We're eager to see the city. I've heard it's a fascinating cross-section of society.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009017|Try either thing and our mechs will blow you apart. But, you know, it's your intestines you're risking, so try what you will.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009016|You want to rush him, or find another way in?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009015|Sorry, little drone, I'd let you in, but I presume you want to stick with this guy and without a permit he's going to stay out here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009014|Hey, is that a U4? Nice drone. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009013|Requesting... Access...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009012|If you knew, why did you come? Arvid wept, some people...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009011|I heard they had sealed the city, I'm not sure why.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009010|If you want in, let's kill him and go in. If not, let's go somewhere where there's at least one less asshole.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009009|It doesn't sound like there is any honor in here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009008|There is no honor in the desert.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009007|Shit, you guys are insane. You stab them and say you're saving them. We have a saying for that in the desert - 'What - The - Fuck'?!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009006|What Outlaw ever understood honor?|Unmoved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009005|Stuff them in here, break them down, leave them weak and call it a fight? You guys really are assholes.|Amused (she doesn't care for Clerics or authority)
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009004|Words like that show you need re-educating.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009003|Interesting. We Clerics do have a most advanced set of technology and yet our justice is primitive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009002|Justice serves all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009001|You're short of men and you waste them on vengeance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00009000|Search complete... It is... zero... Results regarding a life form named... Calaan... found... Ending search process.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008999|You need to get that thing reprogrammed, it's faulty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008998|Searching through data banks...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008997|And, I thought exile was cruel enough...|Unhappy
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008996|Think what you want, Berserker. But you will see what happens when you stand before Calaan one day and he turns you away. Then you will pray for this honor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008995|This is cruelty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008994|It is the will of Calaan. That is enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008993|Death in battle is an honor, so why give honor to failures?|Scornful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008992|What happened? Shit, I haven't had something like that happened to me since, about two weeks ago.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008991|Shit... What the fuck happened? Where is that guy? I'm going to pull hiss ass at through his throat.|Angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008990|How was that possible? It appears, that man was able to manipulate our minds somehow.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008989|What the hell happened? How did we get to the Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008987|What happened? What are we doing at the Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008986|What...happened to us? Suggestion? Another reason to take Elex, it keeps these damn Clerics out of your mind.|Angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008985|That is who we are. The exiled.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008984|We are the victims of the Berserker's Laws. Laws we fought to protect, only to find those very Laws spitting us out into this wilderness.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008983|We are the forgotten, the rejected and the outcast.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008982|What exactly is an exile?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008981|How about people with spare shards to give you? Yeah? Hey? Yeah? No? No. Okay, no.|Talking himself out of  a bribe
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008980|Yes, well, if you Outlaws had laws, then you'd be inlaws. No, I meant...er... With the...Oh, fuck off, Outlaw.|Flustered and failing at a come back
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008979|You know the best thing to do with rules? Why don't you bend over and I'll show you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008978|Wow, you really are a welcoming face aren't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008977|That's because there's nothing worth stealing in Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008976|They wonder why they are short people. We welcome all in Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008975|What is he saying there? I am not lying... Nobody gets by me without a good reason.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008974|Measuring stress level... Potential lie detected... Recommend renegotiation...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008973|Suck it up and live with it, Berserker.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008972|The Clerics say they lead the Free People, yet here they are closing their gate to us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008971|Do you spend all day standing here stating the obvious?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008970|That isn't what I meant by debt, but very well. Take this Elexit as thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008969|Debts are best paid fast, that's something I learned in Tavar|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008968|That isn't what I meant by debt, but very well. Take this Elexit as thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008967|And, debts get paid, fast, or people lose body parts. Show us the damn shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008966|That isn't what I meant, but very well. Take this Elexit as thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008965|It is interesting that you chose the word debt. Did you mean a spiritual debt, or a worldly one?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008964|That isn't what I meant, but very well. Take this Elexit as thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008963|And good work should be paid for, whatever your faction.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008962|I understand what your drone is trying to tell me. Here, take your payment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008961|Analyzing cost of labor... Analyzing compensation... Compensation disproportional... Recommend renegotiation...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008960|An Alb, drone, I suppose you salvaged it, yes? But, I understand its meaning. Here, take your reward.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008959|That isn't what I meant, but very well. Take this Elexit as thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008958|A spiritual debt, or a worldly one?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008957|That isn't what I meant, but very well. Take this Elexit as thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008956|Then pay your debt.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008955|Me? It's up to Baxter? What have I got to do with it?|Playing coy
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008954|No, I suppose, no, that's up to you.|Scared
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008953|Do you want to know, Ray? Do you really want to know?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008952|What's going on? Where is Baxter?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008951|Right as always, Nasty, you have a rare and admirable insight into the world.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008950|Baxter was a moron to ever believe that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008949|Know thyself, know thyself and I definitely know myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008948|It is good to understand your true nature, you will find that advantageous in all your dealings.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008947|I am a man of many talents.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008946|How did anybody convince themselves to take you on as a bodyguard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008945|Right, right...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008944|Ignore him. And, explain what's going on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008943|What is he saying there?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008942|So many rumors flying around, you don't have to believe them all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008941|Blake is dead, isn't he?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008940|So, you manipulated the situation throughout?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008937|Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. Listen to Ray here, always good for life guidance is Ray. Never has people wanting to kill him. Always rolling in shards. Always the best person for advice.|Heavy sarcasm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008936|Shit, Rat. Go work for your money.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008935|You mistake me, Nasty. Profit is what this is about. Think of this as a loan, an investment, and all in the best interests of the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008934|Profit, Rat. You know the rules of Tavar. Now, fuck off before I stick you head on a pole as a warning to others.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008933|You give me shards, I give you a smile of happiness. So, what do you say?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008932|But, this is exchange.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008931|Interesting. Do these direct requests for shards work? Normally, there is some sort of exchange proposed rather than a simple request for Elexit.|Genuinely interested
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008930|It hurts to be judged. Please, make recompense for the injury your friend has done me and loan a fellow a few shards.|Mock hurt
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008929|Squander', now there's a word that sits in judgement.|Touche
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008928|How can we trust you not to squander it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008927|I couldn't have put it better myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008926|I recommend making an appropriate donation in the expectation of future assistance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008925|Analyzing voice stress levels and pitch...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008924|We should help those in need. Please, give him this from me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008923|Beggars and thieves. This is what a life without discipline gives you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008922|Hey, I'm not begging, I am politely requesting a flexible loan.|Unphased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008921|The price is freedom for all. Liberty for Magalan. And, that cost will be paid in blood by the Free People.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008920|This important work, have you thought about what it could be worth? Whatever you've been told, I bet I can get you a better price.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008919|A secret Berserker plan? What is it now? Mystic grass? Magic radishes? Or, shall we sit in a circle and chant until the Albs disappear?|Sneering, mocking the Berserkers.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008918|If Magalan cannot afford failure, surely it would be logical to request more assistance to complete your venture? I am certain we could help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008917|Thank you, Duras.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008916|We will go, Pilgrim. My apologies, we do not wish to disturb you.|Apologetic
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008915|The chance of armed combat has now increased to... 94.7%...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008914|Elex technology, please, get that machine out of here.|Annoyed at Crony
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008913|I am registering increased stress levels... There is a 54% chance of combat being initiated if this continues to increase.|Assessing the Pilgrim.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008912|It is nice that at least one person understands. Thank you, Caja.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008911|You should know that we are grateful to you for all that you do here. I'm sorry to disturb you, Pilgrim.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008910|I wouldn't expect you to understand my work.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008909|Self-important isn't he? Typical Berserker, they think ignorance and plant life will save us. Well, that really would be magic.|Sneering, mocking the Berserkers.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008908|I will relax when I know why you are here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008907|Hey, slow down, friend. Just relax.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008906|You'd better, or I might be tempted to teach him what fighting means.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008905|Take it easy, I will take care of this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008904|You want to fight? Ha, that's hilarious. If this asshole wanted to fight he would've fought. He's hoping you talk him out of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008902|And, what about your friend?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008901|I would prefer not to engage in armed combat at this time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008900|Stop!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008899|If that's what you want, then let's get this started.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008898|Your chance of victory in armed combat is only 43.563 percent. Negotiation would be a better choice for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008897|Right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008896|We are not here to fight...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008895|Will you both stop? I said wait!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008894|Come on, I'll fight the one on the left first.|Defiant
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008893|Wait!|Aggressive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008892|Draw your weapon, I will put an end to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008891|It's over. I mean I hope so. I mean, we'll see. You know, people can be right assholes over old scores.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008890|It's over. That asshole isn't anywhere near brave enough to try anything that might annoy us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008889|Negotiation, promise, threat, counter-promise, all these tactics prove successful. This dispute should be over now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008888|Listen, Oran had better pull himself together, or I'll deal with him myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008887|Analysis suggests this conflict has now been resolved.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008886|Oran will pull himself together. He won't do anything to endanger his tavern.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008885|Petty, emotional infighting, precisely why the Albs have dominated the Berserkers for so long..|With a sneer
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008884|Elex and greed are similar, they both corrupt the weak minded.|Disparaging reply to the profit based question
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008883|These magic rocks, how much Elexit would you say they're worth?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008882|Yes, Outlaw. The world is so much more than mere 'profit'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008881|Oh, 'put the Elex in the magic mountain', is this for real?|Sneering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008880|A lab? Absolutely not! No one can be allowed to use machines on the Mana shrine, it would pollute it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008879|There must be some scientific explanation. If we were to perform an examination of the mountain, perhaps we could recreate this process in a lab.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008878|One of us, but not one of you, hey, Caldrim?|Aware that he's an outsider.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008877|Well, we all have different skills, Duras. I read Elex, you read people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008876|I don't feel anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008875|Elex is usable as a power source and is detectable with the correct sensor equipment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008874|You always were sensitive to these things.|Pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008873|You are right... It's like ripples in water.|Trying to sense the thing Caldrim is talking about.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008872|I am certain that you are capable of feeling it too, Caja.|To Caja
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008871|Yes, you. There is something about you. I can see that you have consumed Elex in some form. You should resist that in future, it will destroy, unless... you follow our ways. |Feeling this out.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008870|Me?|Cautious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008869|You, for example.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008868|Thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008867|Outlaws? We Berserkers look after people fairly. Here, here take this. See?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008866|Wow, and I thought Outlaws pulled cons, but it seems you Berserkers do to. A bonus? Wow, Outlaw junk collectors get paid better than that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008865|You see. We can all get along just fine. Now, fuck off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008864|There really is no need for this. But, here, take that and understand that your work was valued.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008863|Listen, limpdick. We just dug around in the dirt for you, that's not exactly our style. So, kindly put a bit more profit on top of that, or I'll plant you in the soil right by your Seedlings.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008862|I... Uuuh...|Stunned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008861|Are you fucking serious? You call that a bonus? You are fucked in the head my Berserker friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008860|I pay fairly, I'm known for paying fairly, but...here take this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008859|The amount you offered is far from equitable.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008858|Underpayment?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008857|Interesting, some people are prepared to take advantages of others through underpayment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008856|You don't have to get snappy. Here, take this. There is a little extra for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008855|Come on, Born, you're selling him short on that payment and you know it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008854|This is precisely why technology shouldn't be trusted, but...here, take this as a sign of good will.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008853|It is saying that your payment seems too small.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008852|What is that thing saying?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008851|I calculate this payment has a low reward to input ratio is low. A higher payment should have been made.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008850|Look, just because we know each other don't think that...oh, very well, take this, but just because I respect you, Caja.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008849|And, you don't find that a rather small payment, Born?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008848|I did, but...I am prepared to pay a little more.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008847|And, I supposed you consider that pittance to be a reward? |Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008842|We should burn all these farms to the ground.|Hostile
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008841|The Berserkers reckon they can change the whole world with these things? What are they going to change it into? A giant, enormous... plant thing?|Running out of description
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008840|Up and down, up and down. They should sell tickets to people so they could come for a ride. These Berserkers have no idea how to make a profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008838|What a...total, fucking wreck.|Starting out as if admiring then dropping into disappointment.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008837|These guys have magic and what do they do with it? Stand in the water gardening. What a waste.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008836|It's been a while, maybe no one will recognize me.|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008835|Goliet, yeah...I've been here before and, I might have taken a few things and done some a little 'questionable' trading. Let's hope they have short memories.|Weighing up the dangers
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008834|People thrown into Converters alive to extract the Elex from them? However, hard people say the Duke is, he doesn't come close to that.|Observing the Converter
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008833|It looks unstable, but this thing hasn't managed to kill me so far.|Observing the stairs into Tavar. He's used them before
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008832|Yeah, he didn't make it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008831|Tried?'|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008830|My brother tried to climb one of these white towers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008829|We were lucky to get out of there alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008828|There was a leak from one of the hoses and the whole place caught fire.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008827|We shouldn't spend the night in these ruins. My little brother and I stayed in a house like this once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008826|There's always someone worse off than you, hey?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008825|Look at these poor beggars. Scraping out a living and hoping not to get raided.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008824|Xacor. Xacor, Xacor, Xacor...are you sure you want to go in there?|Nervous
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008823|No I know. It was me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008822|It wasn't me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008821|Something stinks here...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008820|I wish my brother could see the Dome here. He always loved this sort of stuff.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008819|I wish my brother could see this. He always was into Old World stuff.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008818|Then again... Look at us. Berserkers and the Clerics. Plants to save the world. Albs that want to destroy it. What the hell is it all about?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008817|The people of the Old World were strange. On the one hand, they built buildings of reinforced concrete, and on the other hand, things like this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008816|We almost died before someone found us. For all it tried to kill us, we made that desert our home.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008815|I remember like it was yesterday crawling through the sand there with my little brother.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008814|The desert looks so peaceful from up here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008813|Anything? I mean...you might be feeling good, but this stuff scares the hell out of me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008812|Of what?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008811|An Alb fortification. Aren't you in the least bit scared?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008810|All this effort for a fucking plant.|Dismissive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008809|All that effort simply to go up...and down. Doesn't that just sum up the Berserkers?|Sarcastic
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008808|I bet this place contained some premium salvage in it at one point.|Observing a ruin
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008807|That's got to mean they are worth something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008806|So, these little plants grow into those World Hearts?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008805|The most impressive pig sty in Edan. I bet there's a Warlord squatting in there somewhere.|Disparaging
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008804|I thought we'd go somewhere more romantic. Like Xacor. But, no, don't worry, I can deal with these treehugging motherfuckers.|Amused at her own joke
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008803|You have a problem with that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008800|Really? You're taking me into the Berserkers' home town?|Dead pan
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008799|The Albs can pull Elex right out of the ground, but the bastards still don't know how to make a profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008798|Sand and rocks and opportunity. Tavar, the land of freedom.|As proud of her homeland as a deadpan cynic can be
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008797|The Duke sent someone out here to fix these stairs. I'll have to tell him whichever asshole it was skipped the job.|Observing the stairs into Tavar
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008796|I always wondered what these were for. They remind me of the windmills at the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008795|Fucked up.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008794|An Outlaw told me they fed people here. They would shove the hoses in their mouths and pump their stomachs full.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008793|To think you must be a seriously fucked up person to decide to spend your life lives with your arms deep in shit, or shoved up the asses of animals. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008792|Right shit pile isn't it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008791|Xacor. Only the Albs would want to live with their asses planted in the snow.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008790|What a stinking fucking mess this place is. No wonder the Clerics are crazy, this stench is enough to turn anyone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008789|There's no chance of you stealing that thing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008788|There's not much in this world that can't be stolen.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008787|You want to steal the Dome?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008786|I wonder if I could steal it...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008785|Now, if we could move that to the Fort, we would never have to worry about the Albs, or the Clerics again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008784|Yeah. And I am pretty sure that he is compensating for something too.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008783|Your brother's tower in the Fort isn't exactly discreet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008782|Whoever built this is compensating for something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008781|What a heap of stones. Don't tell me you're into sightseeing?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008780|Yet, when you're in the Fort, it feels like Tavar is the whole world.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008779|The desert looks so small from up here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008778|Albs, so strong, so superior and there they are...hiding. |Sneering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008777|These World Hearts deserve proper study. I wonder if the Berserkers would allow me to conduct such a study.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008776|Where the Clerics and Albs use Elex, the Berserkers have solved their problems by using nature. Isn't that fascinating?|Enjoying the observation
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008775|If it wasn't for these ruins it would be hard to believe a world so different from ours once existed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008774|These Seedlings are fascinating. Did you know that they require some form of 'transmuted' Elex to grow?|Fascinated by the seedlings, enjoying seeing the seedlings
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008773|An impressive building. I hope the occupants can tell us something of its history.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008772|Just as the Comet caused the creatures to evolve, so it had the same effect on society. Fascinating.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008771|Indeed, all the current factions came into existence after the Comet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008770|My research indicates there were organizations attempting to restore Magalan's plant life before the Comet struck, but none were armed like the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008769|It is interesting. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008768|Goliet, the Berserkers' home town.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008767|Everything is relevant at some point. That is why knowledge is important.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008766|And, this is relevant how?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008765|Sand. Silica particles. It appears much of it was created, or arrived here after the Comet destroyed the plant life here and the ground beneath began to be eroded.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008764|Still, it held up last time I used it. We should be safe.|Not quite reassuring enough.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008763|It is an interesting construction isn't it? It appears they favored speed of construction over safety.|Observing the rickety stairs
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008761|That the people from the Old World prayed to them in the hope he would bring them light.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008760|I read once that they were the symbol of an old god.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008759|These towers have always fascinated me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008758|I wonder what it tasted like.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008757|People probably held their plates under the hoses to receive their portion of protein porridge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008756|Judging by the structure of this box and the hoses attached to it, this seems to have once been some sort of a primitive food release system.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008755|We had better not drink from this lake.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008754|We should not stay here too long.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008753|I won't deny that I am curious about the Albs, but are you sure we are ready for this?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008752|The air here appears to be hazardous.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008751|This Dome is truly a masterpiece of technology.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008750|This structure is intriguing. We should examine it further, if possible.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008748|We should not stay here long, the structural integrity of this building has been compromised.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008747|Maybe, or perhaps knowing who they were helped people to survive what happened. We will never know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008746|Maybe if they'd spent more time on science, the Comet wouldn't have hit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008745|Philosophy is a much neglected area of study, the Old World had more time for it, so my research has shown.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008744|The desert. Our present and our past blown together on the wind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008743|This protective shield is fascinating I would like a chance to examine it more closely.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008742|A World Heart. The hearts of all Berserkers beat with them for they shall heal the world.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008741|We will have to be careful down there. There's a reason these people were sent into exile.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008740|The entrance to the Valley of the Damned.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008739|We pass these ruins everyday. And, I have no idea what they were. That world is lost to us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008738|The question is, why did we let them build it here in the first place?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008737|And, here the Berserkers defeated the Albs and wrecked their Converter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008736|Dust, rock and the ashes of our past. I hate deserts.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008735|Welcome to the desert of Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008734|A dead land full of crazy people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008732|This road was built by us some time ago, they used it for trade, and to bring a World Heart to Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008731|It's like a giant child's toy. I wonder what it was for.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008730|Why build a house where only some rooms have walls?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008729|I wonder what this used to be.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008728|On the other side...well let's be honest, it smells like a raptor fart...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008727|A strange place. On the one side, a beautiful farm on a beautiful lake.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008726|Logic, power, hate. I wonder how the Albs came to exist.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008725|Xacor. Only the Albs would want to make this frozen land their home.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008723|Ignadon... The Land of Fire... I'm not sure even our World Hearts can bring life back to this place.|Observing, introducing the land
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008722|And then they put their trust in a thing like that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008721|People say we're crazy to believe in nature.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008720|More reason for us to work together to get something like it back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008719|Their world is long gone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008718|I mean... Take a look at that thing. Built to supply drinking water. Built to serve a community.|Wistful.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008717|What else could the people of the Old World achieve if they could build something like this?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008716|There's enough space and this area can be defended. It would be a good site.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008715|This looks like a good place to plant a World Heart.|Assessing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008712|Do you see the desert down there?|Observing

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008618|These Seedlings are the source of the Berserkers' power.|Hostile
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008617|Whatever it was in the Old World, it's a nest for rats now.|Assessing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008616|But, a strong one. Attacking it would be costly.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008615|The number of rooms here. Do you think this was a palace, or a breeding station?|Scathing about Ragnar's home
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008613|Goliet. The Berserker's home town. Filth, mud, mold. The biggest virus factory on this side of the mountains.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008612|Progress requires sacrifice. And if anyone needs progress, it's these barbarians.|Dismissive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008611|They probably didn't like their people being fed into it.|Stating fact - observing that the Berserkers have wrecked the Converter - non-judgemental
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008610|An incredible piece of technology. What the Clerics achieved, the Albs have truly taken to a new height. And, the Berserkers have destroyed it. Damn tree loving throwbacks.|Admiring
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008609|My ball sacks are being rubbed raw too.|Throw away.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008608|Ugh, too much information.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008607|I have sand in my armor and sand in my ass. |Grumpy
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008606|Still, it asks the question, who would willingly enter Tavar? Apart from us.|Unhappy about going in.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008605|Well, isn't that appropriate? Where civilized men would build an elevator, the Outlaws build that.|Observing the 'scaffolding' that leads into Tavar. Sneering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008604|Now it is time for the inferior to worship us!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008603|They say people worshipped these towers as gods in the Old World. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008602|I have no idea what this is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008601|Most Old World ruins make some sense to me, but this...?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008600|Plants grown in shit...I can think of much better things to fill your stomach with.|Observing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008599|What a mouthwatering prospect.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008598|Xacor. I can taste the Elex from here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008597|The sooner the better.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008596|One day Magalan will swallow Calaan and all his followers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008595|Ignadon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008594|That technology was invented by Albs and it should have remained with the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008593|Such shield technology is wasted in Abessa. All that to hide refugees and rejects.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008592|Power and strength. It can be admired even in a building.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008590|There will always be the strong to look down upon them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008589|There will always be the weak.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008588|But, there is a lot of Elex here. They should feed the whole land into a Converter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008587|From up here the desert looks as lifeless as its inhabitants are brainless.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008586|And yet it is the Clerics who made the best use of it. We were strong, now, ow I wonder what we are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008585|That protective shield, that is our technology. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008584|So, you survived? Well, you know where my bar is when you need a drink.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008583|So, you survived? I am glad you made it through. May the Claw ever be your companion. May the Claw be your guide.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008581|There's no benefit to us to get involved in their war.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008580|You are fortunate to have survived so far. I hope your fortune continues.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008579|We are going to remain here until we know how the situation above will resolve itself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008578|Or, you will need to climb the mountain if you want to leave.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008577|You are welcome to stay here for now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008576|With the chaos going on up there, we need to keep that hatch closed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008575|Hector wants to talk to you. If you've not caught up with him yet, you should go straight there. He needs to talk to you about the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008574|Well, we don't have to worry about the Clerics' plans for Abessa now, hey?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008572|Not the result we wanted, but at least we don't need to worry about the Clerics, hey?|Making the best of it
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008571|The city belongs to Xacor now. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008570|In any case, the Albs ploughed right through us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008569|I guess throwing those Separatists out would've been a good idea after all, I bet they coordinated things with Xacor from here in the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008568|I guess getting Jorg to help throw those Separatists out would've been a good idea after all, I bet they coordinated things with Xacor from here in the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008567|I guess throwing those Separatists out wasn't a good idea after all, I bet they ran straight to mother Xacor and helped them take the city down.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008566|But, after we'd got control of things, the Dome shield went down and the Albs came straight in and took control of everything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008565|We really could've used that weapons delivery, but somehow we got through anyway.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008564|It was easy to overpower them thanks to that weapon delivery you got through to Paige.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008563|We created a few diversions then we took them down.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008562|And we managed to get enough intel to convince people even without installing that transmitter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008561|We were only able to convince everyone after we got that intel from the bug you installed. Thanks again for that, by the way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008560|Well, knowing the Clerics were up to something, we might have orchestrated a little uprising.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008559|What happened here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008558|Not exactly the plan, but it should stop the Clerics from thinking of invading Tavar. Having Albs in the Domed City will scare the hell out of them!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008557|It's been taken over by the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008556|Well, it seems the Domed City is history.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008555|Ah, it's you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008554|So many dead and it's all my fault.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008553|...the Albs just walked in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008552|But, it went wrong and brought the Dome down and without the shield... |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008551|I only wanted to set up a backdoor so I could get out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008550|You're the only reason that I got the chance to modify that energy regulator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008549|You... You happened.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008548|What happened?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008547|So, you have no idea either, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008546|I don't know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008545|Are you okay? Did any more people from the City survive? Where are the others?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008544|I'm going to stay here. It's going to take me a while to work out where to go now that the Domed City is no more.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008543|I suppose I owe you thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008542|And thanks for the weapon delivery. It was intended to help us take over, but in the end, well, I wouldn't have survived without it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008541|Speak to him if you want to know what he did.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008540|It was all Riley's fault. From victory to a complete loss of profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008539|So, we Outlaws decided to restore the balance. Only, just as we got control, the Albs rolled in overran the whole city and now Xacor controls the whole lot.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008538|It was supposed to be neutral|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008537|We'd had enough of the Clerics pushing us around like they owned the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008536|The Albs happened.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008535|What happened there?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008534|So, another one who survived the mess at the Domed City.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008533|As you're not here with a report, you should go. I have a lot to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008532|I hope that sticks to your conscience.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008531|You failure to stop the Outlaws from receiving those weapons cost me lives.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008530|If the Outlaws had received them... I think their plans may have succeeded.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008529|That makes me even more thankful to you for bringing me the delivery of weapons.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008528|But, I didn't think they'd set out to destroy the Dome.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008527|It was obvious things would explode at some point, the Outlaws have been plotting for some time, |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008526|The Outlaws began an uprising with the help of the Separatists.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008525|The state of things since the uprising.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008524|What do you need a report on?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008523|Then what are you doing here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008522|I haven't brought you a report.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008521|Or, have you brought a report? Come on, what information have you for me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008520|Are you one of the volunteer couriers?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008519|This is supposed to be a city for all the Factions. But, if there is more trouble, I will have no choice but to eject all the settlers from Tavar. Understood?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008518|After all the trouble, we are considering whether to close the city to all Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008517|You! Come here.|Agitated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008516|I never thought the Outlaws would go so far. Now we will just have to hope the Albs don't decide to attack us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008515|I'm lucky I'm still alive after the recommendation you made to me, I am lucky to be alive after the uprising.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008514|Thank you for recommending someone trustworthy worker for the technician's job. There's no telling what an Outlaw, or an Alb would have done during the uprising.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008513|I knew those anarchists would start an uprising. Now, we'll have to rebuild from the chaos they've left us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008512|We have to start rebuilding right now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008511|You, you told me not to speak out against the Separatists and they almost killed me during the uprising you lunatic!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008510|Thanks for convincing me to get the Separatists thrown out of the city. Who knows how the uprising would have gone if they were still here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008509|The Outlaw uprising has been put down. Now, we'll have to start rebuilding.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008508|Thanks for helping get rid of the Outlaws from outside the city. If they'd been in here during the uprising things would have gone ...differently.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008507|Go through, it's not like security matters any more.|Down
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008506|Thanks be to Calaan. We survived the Outlaw uprising.|Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008505|Thanks for nothing. Luckily, we survived the uprising despite your failure to get us those mechs.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008504|Thank you for making sure we got those mechs. Without them, the Outlaws could've taken over the whole city.|Grateful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008503|The rebels paid for what they did to the energy shield.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008502|I can't prove it, but someone must have tampered with the energy regulator I gave you to take to Lutz.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008501|It is difficult to keep a shield like this active, even with good maintenance, but when somebody on the inside tries to sabotage it, we don't stand a chance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008500|The Dome has failed. One of the energy regulators has been has tampered with. We'd better hope the Albs don't take advantage of this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008499|That's what happens when you let Albs into the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008498|Those fucking Outlaws got what they deserved. Alois had the right idea having them all shot.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008497|This city's had it, so, now where am I supposed to go?|Depressed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008496|It was always clear to me that this city had to explode at some point.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008495|Only the best for an adventurer like you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008494|Then show me what you have.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008493|I have the best goods that you could ever need during your travels.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008491|Everything an adventurer like you could need.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008490|What do you have to offer me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008489|You should stock up on supplies before you head out into the wilderness. I have everything you need.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008488|Everything your heart could desire.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008487|What do you have to trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008486|If you want to buy or sell something before you continue on, then I am your man.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008485|Hello, stranger.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008484|Hello, stranger.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008483|Hello, stranger.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008482|I am watching you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008481|Try to steal from us and you are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008480|Speak to our merchant if you wanna buy something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008479|Hands off our goods.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008478|I'm keeping my eyes on you. We protect our goods with our lives.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008477|Try anything you are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008473|So, done. Here is your ID.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008472|I've got to be wary, that desert gang of Outlaws is always trying to find ways to get by me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008471|All right, I'll believe you this once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008470|So, let's say I give you the chance to buy an ID to replace yours. Then, we're both winners.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008469|But, still, all right. Let's face it, we all lose our IDs some days.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008468|Do you Outlaws ever stop lying?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008467|It's mine, I was issued one after all. Must've misplaced it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008466|Yeah, sure, as long as that arrangement involves you pissing off and leaving me alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008465|What is it that your planning?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008464|Despite their inefficiencies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008463|But, I miss my good friend Kral. I'd hoped he'd come and join me here, but he wouldn't leave Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008462|May Calaan guide your way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008461|What convinced you about her?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008460|I'm sorry, this is all I can afford.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008459|Well, I didn't ask you to pay her anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008458|That is less than I paid Nyra as an advance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008457|Then forget her. I want someone dedicated to the job, not the shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008456|Nyra wants to be paid in advance if you want her to work for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008453|It's not like we can go back to Tavar, the Duke's never been keen on Baxter's old boys. So, we're going to risk staying here a bit longer and hope the Albs don't march through here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008452|So, we're going to have to wait for something to change in there. Something's cooking for sure, so we've just got to hope it comes to the boil soon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008451|Well, I was hoping Cooper was going to sort that from the inside, but no dice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008450|Now, he's out, how are you going to get into the City?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008449|So! Done, one fake ID ready to go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008448|Aw, well. Give me the blank ID card, I'll work it up for you now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008447|But, Wick would do anything if would mean getting him two shards he could tap together. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008446|Dead? Shit, I told him whatever was there wasn't worth the risk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008445|Wick is dead, but I found the ID cards on his body.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008444|Just look through all the houses. He should still be there, scavenging.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008443|You should look for him over to the northwest if you are in a hurry to get into the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008442|Well, that there is a good question. You see he has been gone for awhile. He'd gone over to the ruins to see if there was anything worth scavenging there and hasn't come back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008441|Where is Wick?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008440|So, before I can get you an ID, I need you to get me Wick.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008439|You see Wick has all the blank IDs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008438|Good, right, that's the plan...long term.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008437|Deal. Give me the ID and I'll meet Cooper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008436|Does that sound like a deal?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008435|You will find the mechanism that opens it in the wall nearby. Good luck.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008434|When you have it, go west to the castle. There's a hatch behind a house there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008433|Go up to the city. The key should still be on Vito's body.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008432|He'll tell you the other route.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008431|Go up to the city and speak to Vito.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008430|Of course there is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008429|Is there an easier way down here than over the cliffs?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008428|I had you pegged all wrong. You aren't so bad for one of those Calaan crackpots.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008427|Carry on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008426|And, you Outlaws aren't doing yourselves any favors. This isn't Tavar. That's the point. If you want things to be like they are there then why come here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008425|Do you think you can make Jorg stick to his original story?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008422|Profit is profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008421|Why don't we have a dome like this in the Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008420|Now, either answer my question, or head back the way you came.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008419|We are Albs, but we aren't working with the Elexetors in Xacor. Leave us alone and we will leave you alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008418|What are Albs doing out here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008417|We can fix it by pushing them back and getting hold of that detonator. Until then we'll be hoping the Albs don't attack.|Concerned, but concillatory.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008416|You think I don't know that? You can report me when we get back to the Hort, but for now we have to figure out how to fix this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008415|That's your excuse? You're looking sloppy, Albert. It was the same thing with the detonator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008413|The intel was flawed. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008412|We've had forces sending us recon intel from across Abessa and you let yourselves get ambushed?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008411|How could that happen?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008410|So, have you seen Rainer?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008409|We fight for Calaan! We fight for Ignadon! We fight for Magalan!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008408|Remember, these reavers care nothing for your lives, so show no quarter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008407|We can attack, but I can't afford to take any casualties.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008406|Yes. But I'm more concerned about what happens after it. We've only got six Clerics to man two monitoring posts. Three on each side of the dam.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008405|Do you have a plan of attack?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008404|We will honor his memory.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008403|This is a sad day for us. We took care of the reavers but one of our best was killed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008402|Egon fell during the fighting.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008401|Thank you for your help. We will hold this position. The Albs won't get by us!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008400|We'll talk after we have taken care of these reavers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008399|Not now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008398|I hope your skill matches your courage.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008397|You really think you can take them on alone?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008395|Well, even if the Hort didn't send you maybe Calaan did.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008394|Well, if you think you can take them on then I wish you luck.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008393|How can I help, brother?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008392|As far as we know they are at still at the fueling station.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008391|But, you are due a reward nonetheless.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008390|We each have our own chest. You must leave the others untouched.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008389|We believe that the only thing that can help you survive and grow in this new world of ours is Elexit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008388|We don't have ranks and we don't care which faction you are with.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008387|You pledge to rebuild her as she was and to help her be pure once more. Bear the honor with pride.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008386|Pick your armor, choose your weapon and we can trade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008385|I'd like to trade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008384|I can arrange some suitable armor for you. But, it won't come cheap.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008383|So, you've become a Paladin? Congratulations.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008382|I can sell you some Warrior armor if you'd like.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008381|They told me you would show up here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008380|You must be the new Warrior.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008379|Hey, watch it there, I hate it when people mess with my stuff.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008316|As Darius allowed you in, I assume you are someone who could be worthy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008315|Will you teach those skills to me?|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008311|He told me he knew of a place where I could be safe. Where I could learn the skills of a thief.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008310|An Outlaw by the name of Rat found me and helped me get back on my feet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008309|One day, I was robbed, seriously wounded and left to die.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008308|There is little to say. I have lived my life on my own.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008307|I do not want to repeat that experience.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008306|I have met so many people, so many Claws who have disappeared and never shown up again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008305|Who you say you are, means nothing to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008304|You might not want to know anything about me, but I want to know who you are.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008300|I don't want to know who you are, I don't want to know what your name is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008299|I am not interested in where you are from, or what you are doing here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008298|But, before you say a word know this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008297|Hello, my name is Yasma.|Calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008296|That way we can unravel their whole damn network. Thank you, you managed to solve a big problem for us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008295|With a bit of luck, we'll learn who their connections are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008294|And since you provided the information that took us to them, you can claim the bounty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008293|The information you gave us about the thieves operating from the sewers. Well, we found them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008292|Wait, I was just coming to see you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008291|If your information proves to be true, you will receive the bounty that's been offered for it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008290|I'll get a squad together to deal with this group immediately.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008289|No wonder they've avoided being seen.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008288|They're hiding in the sewers?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008287|Thank you for the information. As it didn't lead to the capture of these thieves, you won't get you the full bounty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008286|Well, I suppose it is possible it was them. We shall see if the thefts go down in the coming weeks.|Considering this
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008285|The last one confessed before he died.|Making up a story
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008284|I did. They tried to attack me. There were only two of them and I managed to kill them.|Making up a story
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008283|Is that so? Who found them and what happened to them?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008282|I heard your secret society was just a group of thieves operating from outside the gates.|Making up a story
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008281|There is a gang of thieves operating out of the sewer under the city. They call themselves 'the Claws'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008280|The bounty is still to be claimed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008279|Have you discovered something?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008278|About the secret society you're looking for in the city...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008277|And capture would be best, I want to find out who their connections are. So, if you can find out more about this secret society, I can make you a rich.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008276|I've offered a large bounty for any information that leads to their capture.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008275|From the little I've heard, they're more like a secret society than your regular set of theftmongers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008274|I believe an organized group has started operating here. Not the usual Outlaws, this group seems to be outside the Factions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008273|Keeping the Factions together is always an issue. The Outlaws are always up to something, but things have gotten worse and to cap it all we've had a sharp rise in thefts.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008272|Are you having a lot of trouble here in the city?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008271|However hard our residents make it for us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008270|I want to join you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008269|It will also give us a place to store our riches until we have enough to found a new empire in the new world that will follow. And, so the question is...will you join us in this journey?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008268|And, this place has given us somewhere to stay while the Albs and the Clerics try to blast each other out of existence.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008267|We have no interest in their politics. We simply want to ensure that which ever side wins, our members prosper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008266|The factions are at war. War for land. War for resources. War for war's sake.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008265|We are recognized by our mark, the Claw. Show that and another Claw should assist you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008264|None of us know the entire network, and nobody apart from me knows the size of our organization.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008263|But, we choose who we allow to join very carefully.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008261|Oh, that you will discover as you travel across Magalan. We are everywhere.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008260|We take things, but tell me of a faction that doesn't. And, they are only interested in their cause. We are an organization of independent wealth acquirers who focus on our members.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008259|You mean you're thieves?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008258|We are independent group dedicated to redistributing wealth to ourselves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008257|Here we pledge to work with each other and to keep the word of the Claws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008256|Well, that's a bit formal. It's more a place that people can come and make contact. We arrange deals, we reward.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008255|This is our 'headquarters'. The center of our operations.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008254|What are the goals of the Claws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008253|So, who is in this network?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008252|Who are the Claws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008251|So 'The Claws' were born. Whatever faction, whatever land, we are everything and everywhere and we reward all. Welcome...to the Claws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008250|I was in the Fort in Tavar when the Duke took it from Baxter. One new master to replace the old and so I thought 'why continue like that'?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008249|Factions want it for themselves don't they? All obedience and little reward?|Pitching the organisation
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008248|My name is Hector. I am the leader of our 'network of the disaffected'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008247|What is this place?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008246|Who are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008245|And, I assume you have a lot of questions about the Claws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008244|By Darius, I'm guessing?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008243|I was sent to find you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008242|Take a job from the crate then bring the requested item to a drop box.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008241|For the Claws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008240|So, you must be the one who helped Rat.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008239|So, you're the one who helped Xander sort out his merchant problem?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008238|So, you're the one who helped Katta?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008235|A good.... You're talking about Rat, right? Well, if he is vouching for you then okay, I'll let you through.|Succumbing to the hypnotis,
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008234|A good friend. He says you should let me through.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008233|A friend...A...what friend?|Fighting the suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008232|Is that so? Then I guess you have no business here either. So, why don't you leave?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008231|Come on through. Talk to Hector, he'll answer your questions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008230|That speaks well of you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008229|Hah, not bad.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008228|So, you stole the key?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008227|So, I guess, I'm glad you showed up here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008226|Then you must be the one who killed him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008225|I got it from a friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008224|That's none of your business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008223|From Vito, the barkeeper from the Domed City.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008222|So, I saw. Where did you get the key?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008221|I found the secret entrance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008220|Wrong answer. Get out of here.|Firm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008219|The Claw, what?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008218|Oh, and don't talk to anybody about it, don't ask me about it, just keep it, okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008217|Keep it safe and you'll find out what it is when the time is right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008216|See it as a sort of entrance ticket. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008215|So, seeing as you're a good person. I've got something special here for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008211|Until then, hold on to it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008210|Just don't talk to anybody about this. You'll learn what the claw means when the time is right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008209|And, I'm not just talking shards here, I've got something 'special'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008207|The Claw will be your guide.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008206|That's it.|Now he has the key, and it fits
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008205|I'll need the key.|When clicking on the door to the sewers to unlock it, if you don't have the key. To himself. Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008203|Thank you for understanding. We will try to find away over the mountains as soon as we have rested.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008202|Since you spared us before, you have proved I can trust you. I will tell you our story.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008201|So, I invite you to stay here and contemplate with us, brother.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008200|In the hope that those words can be the salvation of others, that they can save all of Magalan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008199|Now, I am spreading the teachings that saved me from destroying myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008198|Rainer built me up, gave purpose to my life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008197|I was blind to who I could be.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008196|When brother Rainer found me I was just a wretched pile of misery.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008195|I am Oswald.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008194|Who are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008193|Now go. Return to me once you have completed your pilgrimage.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008192|Go out into the world and show them the way of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008191|I have nothing more for you here Paladin. You must determine your own course.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008190|Finish the work you have been given, Legate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008189|Prove yourself, Acolyte.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008188|Act in the Name of Calaan and we will accept you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008187|We don't have anything to say to each other, Outlaw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008186|I have nothing to say to a Berserker.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008184|That's what I do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008183|Assembly lines, manufacturing and repair in a nice warm workshop.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008182|Oh, no, no I've had no field training.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008181|Why don't you fix those mechs yourself?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008180|Which is crazy! If we fall, then who is going to stop the Albs sweeping all the Free People from Magalan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008179|We've taken losses in our battle with the Albs. And, now the Berserkers and the Outlaws are trying to take advantage of that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008178|I acted against Calaan, I must face my punishment. Let my faith be proven.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008177|No...no...no...|Mumbling to himself, scared at his predicament - he faces death for breaking the law
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008176|No, no, no... I am not ready yet... Calaan will guide me... Calaan must offer me salvation.|Mumbling to himself, scared at his predicament - he faces death for breaking the law
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008175|Leave me to my prayer. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008174|And, so I bring honor to the souls who break Calaan's commandments.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008173|Only an honorable death can purify a tainted soul.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008171|For only an honorable death can bring salvation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008170|Here, we bring peace and honor to those who refuse Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008169|Then carry on and may Calaan bring you peace.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008168|I don't want to disturb you, I'm just looking around.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008167|What is this place?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008166|What is you want? It's prayer time, so make it quick.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008165|If anything will push back the power of temptation, it's what you'll see in there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008164|So, go in and look around. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008163|Well, as it happens you can. Reinhold recently ordered that everyone can enter to see with their own eyes what we do with heretics.|Volte-face
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008162|Can you walk in and look around?|Unfriendly, offputting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008160|You are here at the Chamber. The palace of sinners. Break the Commandments of Calaan in Ignadon and the Chamber will welcome you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008159|Nice try. But, you can't enter this area. Move along and keep clear.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008158|Can I look around?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008156|What is this area?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008155|Past you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008154|Stop! Where do you think you are going?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008153|The machine components you see on some wasteland mutants? We believe those allow the Albs a measure of control over the mutants. But, it is a crude form of the suggestion we practice here.|Explaining then dismissive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008152|Unless you know how to reset a K4 drone mod, can you leave me in peace?|Busy, distracted
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008151|But, hey, more fun for you!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008150|I can't touch that stuff now I'm in charge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008149|You can keep them if you want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008148|Ah, yes. I only asked for them to keep you busy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008147|I have the chems you wanted from Doc.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008146|What part of 'I have to work', don't you understand? Now, fuck off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008145|Are you still following me around?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008144|Fuck off, I'm working here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008143|Hey? Are you following me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008142|The drone's down there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008141|Then, when you're standing in front of it, look right and you'll see a canyon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008140|If you go to it you'll find the cliff wall fast enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008139|Look, you see the beacon over there?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008138|Yeah, why would I give you the wrong coordinates?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008137|Are you sure these coordinates are correct?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008136|Just try not to, you know break every bone in your body when you jump down there. You being immobile would put a hole in my plan. Good luck.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008135|There's an opening down there on the canyon wall below Chloe's shop. It should lead directly into the cellar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008134|You'll have to drop into the canyon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008133|But, the Rat always has a plan. There is another way into the cellar. I didn't mention it before because the path is kind of dangerous.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008132|Yeah, I thought I could distract her for longer. She used to find me so charming.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008131|That wasn't a lot of time you gave me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008129|I don't have any new orders for you, Captain. You can find your own way forward now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008128|And, remember, if you want to be named a Enforcer you will have to prove yourself worthy. So, speak to the district overseers, Chloe, Bob, Big Jim, you need their word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008127|You know what you have to do if you want to reach the rank of Captain. Speak to the district overseers, Chloe, Bob, Big Jim, you need their word to get promotion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008126|Welcome to the Outlaws, Runner. Wear your new armor with pride and for profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008125|Watch your step here, Cleric, or you will be thrown into the canyon.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008123|I have nothing for you. Come back another time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008122|One of them, it depends on the day.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008121|And, you're the guard here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008120|Here, that is everything we have.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008119|Many thanks, stranger.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008118|These Clerics put things in your mind, I hope you keep your own thoughts in your head.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008117|You should think on yourself. Are you sure you're here because you want to be?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008116|Really. We'll gather ourselves and set out for home soon. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008115|We thank you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008114|No, please, no!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008113|I have orders to kill you. I'm going to follow those orders.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008112|You can go, I'll tell Hagen you paid with your lives.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008111|I don't care about faith, pay me and you can go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008110|It's for your conscience. We want to return to our families. If you believe, trust those words. If you don't...then you should let us escape the lie.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008109|I have heard enough. You must die.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008108|Alright, you don't have to die. I will spare you. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008107|You've spoken out against Calaan, now you call on his words?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008106|If you believe in Calaan, you know his teachings are of wisdom, of knowledge, of caring. If you believe that, you should spare us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008105|Yes, you must die!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008104|Give me a reason not to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008100|And, now you are here to kill us?|Afraid
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008099|Whatever your thoughts, we'd rather die than return there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008098|So, we're going back, to our real homes. You're new, aren't you? How do you know they've not done, won't do, the same to you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008097|Some of us came to. We remembered who we were, what we wanted...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008096|They were forcing us to fight for them through suggestion. Forcing us to fight against our will.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008095|I don't know what you've been told about initiation, but a lot of it's shit. The Hort say they're saving people, but some of the Clerics...they don't care our lives.|Appealing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008093|Then I have no choice, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008092|We're not being made slaves again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008091|We're not going back. We might not be armed, but we'll defend ourselves against anyone who threatens us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008090|I won't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008089|You shouldn't trust me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008088|If you want me to abandon my orders, you need to start explaining.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008087|You must already suspect the truth?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008086|You'll need this if you're going to escape from Ignadon. Will that buy me a story?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008085|Yes... Of course... I remember you. I am sorry I didn't recognize you at first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008084|Because, I am a friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008083|Why should I trust you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008082|Why did you flee from the Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008081|Hagen has branded you as heretics and renegades.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008080|And, you've been sent after us, have you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008079|You didn't happen to just come by here, did you? What do you want here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008077|Then you are welcome amongst us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008076|Yes, I couldn't stand it anymore.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008075|You've been accused of heresy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008074|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008073|Did you flee from the Hort too?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008072|The renegade heretics are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008071|The renegade heretics have been taken care of.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008070|Dismissed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008069|Very good. Then report that to Reinhold.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008068|Dismissed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008067|Good. Then go and handle it.|Straightforward
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008066|No, I can handle it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008065|Dismissed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008064|If you aren't up to this job, then you aren't worthy of achieving the rank of Paladin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008063|Yes, count me out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008062|Yes. There are ten missing, we're not sure how many are rogue, and how many were killed by the heretics when they escaped. Is that all right, or is that too many for you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008061|More than six renegade heretics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008060|Come back when they are dead.|Indicating his preference
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008059|Judgement has been passed and they need to be brought back, or executed..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008058|There's at least six of them gone rogue, escaped the Hort and taken up residence there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008056|I could use another man. So, let's get right to your job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008055|Correct.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008054|You're the new Legate. Correct?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008053|Reinhold sent me. He says you have a job for me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008052|I had heard rumors, but...this is not who the Clerics are. I will have this investigated. We stand for the Free People and that must be clear.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008051|Well, these Outlaws didn't want to be Clerics. That's why they escaped.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008050|Nonsense. Suggestion cannot force people to do what they don't want to do. That's part of the art, making them feel like the thing you're suggesting is what they want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008049|I am obliged.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008048|Thank you for trying to complete your mission.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008047|The shortage of personnel here makes it tempting to send as few people as possible, that can be counter productive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008046|Then it was a mistake to have asked this of you. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008045|They were Outlaws who had been forced to become Clerics through suggestion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008044|False in what way?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008039|They were too strong for me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008038|Your information was wrong. They weren't traitors.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008037|They deserved sympathy. Or, is Calaan always vengeful?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008036|Didn't kill them, or you sided with them? Treason is punishable by death, this is Calaan's word. Have you anything to say before I pass judgement on you?|Stern.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008035|No, I didn't kill them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008034|You should focus on Balder's task next. Come back when you have made progress there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008032|Good. Then I shall take your word that this is true.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008031|They are dead. I killed the heretics in Calaan's name.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008030|Because, my scouts reported that they had seen them recently.|Fishing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008029|Are you being honest with me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008028|Yes, I killed them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008027|Then Calaan has seen justice done in his name?|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008026|The renegade heretics are dead.|This is the lie
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008025|I will ensure that questions are asked. As I do, you should receive your reward for your service.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008024|No one in the Hort can understand how this has happened. How such treason was fomented without being seen.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008023|May all those who would follow their example learn from their fate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008022|Then Calaan has seen justice done in his name.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008021|The renegade heretics are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008020|Treason must not go unpunished.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008019|You will see that this punishment is carried out in the name of Calaan. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008018|They killed a number of guards and fled the Hort. The punishment for this and for their heresy is death.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008017|And that starts with practicalities. I was going to ask him to take care of a group of renegades far to the south of Ignadon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008016|But, we must find a way forward. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008015|Yes... I... I wouldn't have though that. That is a terrible loss. For all of us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008014|Hagen is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008013|Live your life according to Calaan's rules and you will open your path to enlightenment and a place in the Infinite Skies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008012|I am counting on you to go out into the world and convince people that the path of Calaan is the only true way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008011|We are honored to have you amongst us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008010|You have proven to be a loyal servant of Calaan ready to take on the duties of a Paladin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008009|A new life begins for you today.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008008|You have earned it and you can be proud that you have achieved this rank.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008007|I seek promotion to Paladin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008006|We will promote you to the rank of Paladin for a small donation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008003|It speaks well of you that you wish you act in Calaan's name.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008002|About my duties as a Legate...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008001|Legate, you are dismissed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00008000|Report to Hagen and Balder. They will tell you how you are to serve Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007999|You will identify potential candidates and bring them here to be initiated.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007998|With your newfound power of suggestion, you are to go out into the world and recruit new believers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007997|But, even a Legate has obligations to Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007996|From now on, you may call yourself Legate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007995|Calaan thanks you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007994|Then come back when you have it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007993|No, I don't have the Elexit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007992|Yes, I have it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007991|Do you have the donation that Calaan requires?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007990|You proved yourself worthy of this rank in the name of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007989|I would like to reach the rank of Legate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007988|For a small donation, for Calaan only awards those who are prepared to make the necessary sacrifice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007987|For you, that means you have a chance to reach a higher rank here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007986|We are at war. We need every believer we can get.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007985|You have completed the tasks that were set for you. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007984|And, you should also report to Martha, she will have a task that will prove your humility, for all of Calaan's servants must be humble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007983|Come back to me when you have mastered this skill.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007982|But, you still have to prove to me that you have mastered the skill of suggestion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007981|All Acolytes must show their devotion and it is good that you learn more of his land - Ignadon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007980|Then you honored Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007979|I have returned from my pilgrimage.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007978|There have to be more of those vermin somewhere.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007977|I can't see a thing. I try and leave here, I'm just going to walk into trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007976|Or, for whoever helped me. If it wasn't you, give it to whoever it was?|Unsure
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007975|Well, thanks whoever you are. Here, I have something for you. You saved my skin there.|Generous
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007974|But, you helped me, didn't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007973|My eyesight's isn't good enough to see those damn creatures these days let alone anything else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007972|You, you, you were there helping me weren't you? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007971|We'll take what we want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007970|Is that all? You have more on you, don't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007969|Wrong answer, friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007968|Not for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007967|Here, take these.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007966|You see we really need a few shards. What do you think? Will you give us some?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007965|We could really use your help here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007964|Hey. It's good that you came by.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007963|Take what you need and get out of here, please.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007962|Please, don't tell anyone we live here. We don't want to attract any reavers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007961|Please let us live here in peace. Take what you need and go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007960|Take what you need then leave. Please, keep this place secret.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007959|Please! Don't do anything to us. We are just trying to live peacefully.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007958|You may go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007957|We expect you to behave decently while you are here, understood?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007956|A good decision.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007955|I will pay my fine. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007954|Now leave.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007953|So, if you value your life as we value the law, find the shards and you will pay for your crimes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007952|And should you attempt to leave without paying your fine then a bounty will be placed on your head.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007951|Very well, but you will not be allowed to trade here until that fine is paid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007950|I'm not paying you a shard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007949|But, you must return here to pay the fine as soon as you have the shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007948|Failure to pay these fines can lead to execution, but I will withhold that sentence for now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007947|I don't have enough to pay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007946|I consider your fines as paid in full.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007945|Thank you for paying me so quickly.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007944|I will pay my fine. |

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007940|You are accused of assault.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007939|You are wanted to face charges for various crimes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007938|Halt!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007937|You don't fucking listen, do ya?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007936|I said piss off!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007935|Piss off!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007934|May Calaan protect you, stranger.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007932|Thank you. Thank you. I'd've been dead without you.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007930|I'm not hiding anything. Really. You have everything I own.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007929|Give me what you're hiding.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007927|I've already given you everything!|Scared
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007926|Give me the Elexit you're carrying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007925|Fucking reavers, they came out of nowhere. Keep your eyes open there are more of them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007924|Return to Reinhold and report to him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007923|And, since you have learned the art of suggestion, you have my blessing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007922|Now, you must learn the art of suggestion if you are to advance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007921|Then, Calaan accepts you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007920|I have.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007919|You have completed the four tests and showed devotion at each of the shrines?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007918|Good luck.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007917|When you have reached the third of the shrines you are almost done. You only have to head east in order to complete the circle of your pilgrimage.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007916|And, from there, head south to the third shrine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007915|You will find the second shrine on the right side of the road.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007914|From there, you have to head northwest. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007913|The first shrine is found directly outside the entrance to Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007912|The shrines are found along the wayside of the old roads and paths.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007911|I have returned from my pilgrimage.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007910|Where can I find the shrines I must visit?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007909|Then, I and Calaan will find you worthy of the next step in your enlightenment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007908|Once you have completed these tests, return here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007907|And, at each one you will face a test from Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007906|You must visit each of the four shrines along the path that traverses Ignadon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007905|It is a trial of dedication.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007904|What must I do for this pilgrimage?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007903|It is not to be shared with the likes of you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007902|No. Our knowledge is only for the faithful.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007901|But, first you must complete your pilgrimage, that is something required of all new Initiates.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007900|And, I will teach you, once you are ready to learn.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007899|Then he must have told you that every Acolyte is required to learn the basics of suggestion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007898|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007895|I can try. What would you like to learn?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007894|Can you train me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007893|I assume Judicator Reinhold sent you to me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007892|Well, it is good to see new believers in our ranks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007891|It seems you decided to become a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007890|Keep practicing, maybe you one day you will manage to use your power of suggestion on me.|Good natured encouragement.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007889|You can be sure that it won't work. And, you are quite likely to anger them with any such attempt.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007888|But, please remember. Never try to use suggestion on people who have a stronger will than you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007887|It seems you have completed that step in your initiation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007886|No... No, no, no. . That was creative. I hadn't counted on you having gained such strength so early in your education.|Realising he is falling under the influence of the suggestion, with a laugh
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007885|The Outlaws?... Yes... They are actually... No...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007884|I am impressed! That was really good for a beginner.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007883|I... No... how? What? No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007882|The Outlaws are good people and you are their friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007881|Calaan does not exist. Your god is a lie!|Using his suggestion skill
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007880|I want you to try to shake my faith in Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007879|Ah, really? Then please, demonstrate your new found skill.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007878|I have learned suggestion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007874|I will offer Calaan words so he will support you in your quest to become a true Acolyte.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007871|And, Martha will give you a task that will show your humble dedication to all who serve Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007870|Again, Balder can take you through what is required of you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007869|You must also undertake a pilgrimage to prove your faith to Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007868|You should report to Balder. Calaan's blessing has made him our most able Suggestor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007867|Every Cleric must learn the skill of suggestion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007866|Where should I begin my initiation?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007865|About my duties as an Acolyte...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007864|To do that you must prove loyal and able. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007863|Those who prove worth will find themselves promoted to Legate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007862|As an Acolyte, you are to work for the community and prove your faith to Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007861|What are the duties of a Cleric Acolyte?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007860|Here, a little gift from me... |With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007859|Aaah. A new Captain... Good, good.|With a laugh

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007857|Look, l... look... A new Outlaw...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007856|I will call for you if I need you again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007855|You're one of the few who really earned it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007854|You actually made it to Captain.|Grudging admiration
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007853|Let me know if I can help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007852|I hope you find what you're looking for here in the entertainment district.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007851|Congratulations, Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007850|Thanks, man. I won't forget you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007849|Alright. Alright. You don't have to get bent out of shape.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007848|Don't spend everything at once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007847|We're also trained to kill assholes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007846|Well. You Captains have got to have a few extra shards, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007845|What's that got to do with you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007844|Hey, you are a Captain now, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007843|Wow, look at you. One of the Duke's new Enforcers. Welcome to the level of the cool people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007842|Here, have this one on the house.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007841|What can I get you, Captain?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007840|Tell the barman you can have a beer on the house.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007839|Not many manage to reach the rank of Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007838|You really have proved to be impressive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007837|So, go forth and travel your own path, good luck to you!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007836|Unfortunately, since you are your own boss now, I don't have any more tasks for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007835|Here, take this in recognition of your success.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007834|But, you are nonetheless deserving, my friend.|With a smile
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007833|I mean, you didn't quite with my style.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007832|You really did it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007831|So, let's get it back before he has our balls cut off and nailed to the gate at the Fort.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007829|Please, go to the blacksmith and collect your new armor. Your new life begins today.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007828|So, do the Duke's duty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007827|You are the Duke's face and the Duke's voice|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007826|From this day on you only take orders from the top.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007824|Okay. You earned it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007823|I want to become a Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007821|So, you have opened the way to be named Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007820|You've persuaded all of the District Overseer to give you their word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007819|You've worked quickly.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007818|Chloe is vouching for me as a Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007817|Yeah, strange that the word of any man who has the word 'mad' in his name gets listened to at all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007816|I have Mad Bob's approval.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007815|Tell Mad B...the Scrap Baron that we killed these Berserkers.|Correcting himself from saying Mad Bob
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007814|You'd better go back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007813|That was all of them. Good fight. Doubly good seeing as the Duke won't cut our balls off now.|Pleased/ relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007812|The Duke wants this canyon. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007811|Don't leave any alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007810|We're doing Magalan a favor killing these perverts.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007809|Can you believe they actually have sex with trees?|Disgusted
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007808|I'm ready. Let's attack.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007807|Okay, so you're ready?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007806|About time. We've been running a real risk of being spotted by the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007805|Yes. We're to start the attack now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007804|Ah, you must be the new guy Mad Bob promised us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007803|Now you can piss off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007802|Job done. Tell William you have my word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007801|Then their bodies can feed that damn forest of theirs.|Pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007800|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007799|They're all dead?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007798|The attack on the Berserkers was successful.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007797|Which means... we can start selling them our chems!|Pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007796|We'll show the Berserkers what it means to occupy our land. And, with them gone, we will have a way into Edan and the rest of their kind.|Determined
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007795|He'll wait for you there before starting the attack.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007794|Good. Meet with Striker and tell him I sent you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007793|You'll find Striker waiting there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007792|You'll find a waterfall there. He'll be waiting by the pool at the bottom of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007791|Head to the west, you'll see some sort of giant structure from the Old World.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007790|Listen to him, he's a survivor. You can learn from him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007789|One of the Duke's men, he killed four of Baxter's Captains on his own.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007788|I'll get it done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007787|Where should I meet Striker?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007786|Who is this Striker?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007785|Then you'll get my word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007784|You're going to make sure it succeeds.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007783|He is leading an attack on those forest loving Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007782|Then you can learn from another Captain - Striker.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007781|I know you need my word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007780|Plans, you need my help with. You won't make it without me, without my word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007779|Yes, I need your word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007778|I'm just telling you my plans.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007777|And, so you need my word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007776|I want to become a Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007775|But, you should know, you're not the only one seeking this honor. There are others who are looking for promotion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007774|Let's hope you bring us all that sort of profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007773|He believes in profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007772|I'm betting he lined his pockets before you got that word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007771|Rat has given me his word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007770|You are the only one eligible for promotion now. Congratulations.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007769|I have already discussed everything with William.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007768|So, I can give you my word now that Erin and Smoke are out of the way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007767|Okay. He will get the money.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007766|Here is the gift for William and the fight I lost against Smoke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007765|I lost the fight against Smoke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007764|Now, if you can defeat Erin, my word belongs to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007763|Very good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007762|I defeated Smoke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007761|Well? What do you think about that, my friend?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007760|So, if you give me the money, I will give it to William and you will get my word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007759|I've already spoken with William. He would be prepared to look past this lost fight for a small gift.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007758|Your loss isn't good is it? But, I wouldn't be here today if I didn't have a plan for everything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007757|Yes... I heard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007756|Right, right. I will send this cash to William.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007752|Now, you just have to defeat Smoke and you will have a clear shot at promotion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007751|That is good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007750|Here is the gift for William and the fight I lost against Erin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007749|I lost against Erin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007748|I defeated Erin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007747|Well, my friend, have you defeated Smoke and Erin?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007746|About my promotion to Captain...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007745|But, good luck!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007744|But, remember, you can't afford to lose. Losing would make it really hard for you to take their place as a Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007743|Go and challenge them to a fight in the Arena.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007742|Okay. Good decision.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007741|You need to beat them in the Arena. Not at night in a dark alley.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007740|What? No! Are you crazy? They have served the Duke well. We don't want them dead!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007739|I will fight them in the Arena, if I must.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007738|Okay. I will kill them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007737|So, here's my plan. You defeat Erin and Smoke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007736|So, you see, my plan has your interests at the heart of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007735|They've both just got back from expeditions that should have earned them the rank of Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007734|There are two other guys who want to be named Captain - Erin and Smoke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007733|Well, there is one little catch.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007732|Ha. You are starting to get to know me, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007731|Yes, of course, my friend... Of course. Well... There is just one problem you could help me out with first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007730|Come on, Rat, what's the catch?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007729|You are giving me your word just like that?|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007728|Then you have my word, friend. After all, we have gone through a lot together.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007727|I need your word to reach the rank of Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007726|You'll have trouble taking it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007725|I'm loyal and that makes the position mine.|Snapping back
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007724|Confidence like that normally only comes from a kissass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007723|Don't tell me they have already given them your word?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007722|About my promotion...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007721|If you're not prepare to wait your turn behind them, or you'll have to persuade the District Overseers to back you instead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007720|Come to me when all the District Overseers have given you their word. That is the only way to become a Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007719|So, we're clear.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007718|This armor is reserved for the most powerful people in the Fort and that means the Duke's family. That means you don't get it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007717|Don't get carried away.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007716|That's obvious.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007715|What comes next? How do I get armor like yours?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007714|Waiting was never a strength of mine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007713|You really can't wait, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007712|Take it easy. You were just promoted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007711|What do I have to do for a promotion?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007710|You leap as high as you can. You understand?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007709|If they tell you to jump.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007708|You serve the Duke. You serve the District Overseers. You will ensure they aren't challenged by anyone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007707|And, new duties.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007706|This comes with a nice, shiny set of armor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007705|I am ready to take the rank of Enforcer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007703|Then it seems the Duke has a new Enforcer in his ranks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007702|You have the word from all three District Overseers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007701|I did what you wanted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007700|But, you've persuaded him and his word is what you needed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007699|Okay. I would have thought he would have proved difficult. After all, he needs to prove himself first, him being a new Captain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007698|Rat has given me his word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007697|They've all earned their place. All proven themselves loyal. But, they all have their little problems and they all want more.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007696|He's already stepped down as a district overseer, he didn't even need to be pushed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007695|Well, then. Go on, little birdie. And, don't come back to me without the shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007694|Sure, Boss. I'll do it right now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007693|In a canyon to the southwest, go find him and get my shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007692|Yeah, sure, I'll do that for you, Rat. Where can I find the guy? Who would dare rip you off? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007691|So, I need someone I can trust to bring those shards back to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007690|I don't know exactly how much this guy stole, but I know where he's hiding the shards.|Pretending to confide
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007689|You see, one guy has ripped me off.|Pretending to confide
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007688|I just wanted to thank my collector for the good work he's been doing. It's good to have someone you can rely on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007687|Hey, Rat. What can I do for you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007686|Hey, Burns.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007684|And, I have thought of a very special job for Burns to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007683|Oh, I have a very special job to send him on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007682|But, don't worry, I don't think less of you. But, I will take care of him.|Concilliatory
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007681|Because, he cheated me on the last collection.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007680|Well, I checked up on him and either you were wrong, or he was playing straight that day.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007679|I asked you to check on Burns my protection money collector.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007678|But, you did what I asked you to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007677|Please excuse me if I check that myself, friend, but I think you must have miscounted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007676|Hahaha. Are you serious? I can't believe that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007675|But, you did what I requested.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007674|I may check up, just in case you miscounted, or this is a one off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007673|Is that a fact? Well good, so be it.|Surprised, still suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007672|But, first, you my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007671|And I shall take care of this one right away.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007670|Oh, well, the Rat always has a plan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007669|I knew it. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007668|He actually gave you too much.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007667|No. 300 shards is correct.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007666|He was lying. He didn't give you everything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007665|He was here and gave me 300 shards, was that right, or is he lying to me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007664|About Burns...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007663|So, tell me what you saw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007662|Burns just brought me the shards. I assume you followed him?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007661|Right. Well, there's more due tomorrow.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007660|That's all I got today.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007659|You sure that's everything? Seems light...|Mildly suspicious, prompting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007658|300 today, 100 each.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007657|Burns, Burns, was I right to give you Blake's job? You got the money?|Overly friendly, assessing his collector
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007656|Right, right, just give me the fifty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007655|Are you try to screw and old friend out of money? Fifty is all I have.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007654|Fifty isn't enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007653|You might want to pay some protection money yourself, his collectors keep disappearing. Here's your fifty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007652|Lunatic, hey?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007651|What, you work for that lunatic now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007650|I am here collecting protection money for Rat.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007649|What do you want, Burns?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007648|Good to know your memory is working.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007647|Two hundred, yeah, yeah. That's right. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007646|Two hundred right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007645|I'm paying for me and Ricochet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007644|Yeah, yeah. You're here for the protection money.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007643|I'll be back next month for another hundred.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007642|He won't. |Certain
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007641|Alright, alright. But, if Blake turns up....|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007640|That means you're paying me. It's 100 a month, right?|spoken as 'one hundred'
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007639|You can forget, Blake. Rat is in charge here now. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007638|I pay Blake every month. Where is he?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007637|You haven't paid your protection money.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007636|Hey you!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007635|I have to work, so stay out of my way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007634|And, there he is, that's Burns there. Go, stick to his heels!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007633|Then when he returns, you can tell me if he's given me the right amount.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007632|Then count up how many shards he collects.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007631|So, I want you follow Burns, without him noticing, while he collects the protection money.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007630|That is what I wanted to hear. That's a plan in action. I know I could count on you, my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007629|See you around, my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007628|I will have William informed right away.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007627|You have my word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007626|Rat doesn't forget his friends.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007625|You gave me those shards, when I really needed them and you helped me reach my current lofty position.|Pleased with himself
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007624|Okay, okay. I've not forgotten how much you helped me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007623|And, since I am in charge here now, you won't get my word until you've done me this favor, my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007622|No. No, sorry. Maybe, you think I'm resentful, but I still haven't forgotten that you refused me that fifty shards I asked for.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007621|I'm not following Burns. You're just going to have to give me your word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007620|I will follow Burns.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007619|Watch him, follow him and tell me if he is lying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007618|That's where you come in, friend. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007617|But, I don't trust him as far as I can piss.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007616|One of them is Burns...he's supposed to collect the protection money here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007615|Taking over Blake's position meant taking on Blake's guys.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007614|At least listen to what I'm proposing. It'll be advantageous to us both.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007613|I know, I know. I just kept telling you things so you would do something for me. But, this time it's different. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007612|You have exploited me enough, just give me your word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007611|What do you need?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007610|Help me with it and you will get my word. I promise.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007609|But, I really need your help with a little something I can't sort out myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007608|... Yeah, I know what you are thinking now... 'It was clear that the old Rat wouldn't give me his word so easily'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007607|Shall as in, 'in the future'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007606|Very well, you shall have my approval.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007605|Straight to business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007604|Of course you do, my friend, don't be so impatient.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007603|Give me a straight answer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007602|So, do I get your word, or what?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007601|It's a strange world we live in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007600|And, still we have ranks and you need approval to climb them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007599|People without rules and laws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007598|You know... This is a paradox. We call ourselves Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007597|I need your approval so William will promote me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007596|I'm happy to help if you need me. After all, we have been through some stuff together!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007595|I'm happy for you that you have your choice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007594|If I was free I wouldn't have joined 'that' lot, but hey! Who am I to judge you?|Disappointed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007593|And, of all of them, he joins the Outlaws. You made the right choice.|Pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007592|Look at this! My friend has grown up and joined a faction!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007591|Have the District Overseers given you their word?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007590|About my promotion...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007589|When you have their word come back to me. Then we will see what's next.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007588|So, talk to Mad Bob, Chloe and Blake's successor, Rat.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007587|Until you get the approval of three of his Overseers you won't get anywhere.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007586|You have to prove to the Duke and the District Overseers that you are loyal to them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007585|If you want the benefits here, you earn them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007583|You're not going to find the shards to make that happen, not while the Duke's in charge here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007582|Try threatening someone from the Duke's family and you'll end up dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007581|Right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007580|I want your armor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007579|Can't I just buy a promotion?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007578|And, what do I have to do exactly?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007577|You'll have to do something to earn those promotions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007576|If you want to make it to be a Enforcer, or Captain, well...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007575|And, you want something more already?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007574|You just got a set of Runner's armor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007573|How do I get promoted?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007572|The battle is done. You fought well. You should take pride in that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007571|Make ready your weapons. There are more below! None may survive!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007569|Watch the pit, I don't want to see anyone fall in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007568|That was a good fight. But, it is not over yet!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007567|Get ready, men! Time to go!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007566|Let's show these Outlaws what it means to be Berserkers!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007565|Let's go, men!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007564|You are proving my faith in you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007563|You shall become a Paladin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007562|I will give you my pledge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007561|Reopening that road is a great service to the Berserkers. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007560|I am pleased you survived the battle. It is time they were made to pay the blood the Blood Path has demanded from us.|If the player accepted the quest in a friendly way
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007559|Your mouth may speak badly of you, but your actions prove true.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007558|You have proved your worth.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007557|And, evidently you are still alive.|If the player was rude before
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007556|The Blood Path has been cleared of Outlaws, the road to Tavar is open.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007555|We will hold this position. Go back to Angrim and report our success to him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007554|You fought well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007553|I think that's the last of the Outlaws taken care of. Good work.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007552|Damned Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007551|We finish these Outlaws, we free the Blood Road for Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007550|But that is enough questions. We are not here to chat. It is time to get this job done..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007549|It's my job to make sure these Outlaws leave, or pay in blood.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007548|I'm the Paladin in charge here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007547|I am Gardar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007546|Who are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007545|They're stopping our supplies, our trade and it will give the Outlaws an easy way through Edan to Goliet. We can't allow that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007544|Only a group of Outlaws have taken control of the road.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007543|We built a road, the Blood Path, into the Tavar desert to keep our supply routes open, now we need it to deliver supplies to the World Heart there. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007542|Explain to me again what we're doing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007541|Then let's go!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007540|I'm ready.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007539|Are you ready to attack?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007538|So, you know the score?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007537|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007536|You were sent by Angrim, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007535|For our attack against the Outlaws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007534|You were waiting for me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007533|Yes, that's right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007531|You must be the man we're waiting for.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007530|A Paladin, Gardar, has led a party to wipe out the Outlaws and reopen the Blood Path. I want you to join him and help him in his mission.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007528|If we don't dislodge them, we'll lose trade with the Free People in that area and any chance of supplying our World Heart.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007527|The Outlaws have sent raiders to seize the main road from Goliet to Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007526|The Outlaws have sent... I was going to say soldiers, but they don't have that discipline.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007525|That will speak louder than words.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007524|If you want to show real strength take the task I have for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007523|Then you will spend your life losing friends and allies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007522|For that is the only way you will gain my backing to become a Paladin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007521|And, are you ready to hear of the challenge I offer you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007520|Apology accepted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007519|I never apologize.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007518|I am here to apologize.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007517|Or, have you come to apologize?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007516|The incomer returns. Are you here to throw more insults?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007515|That being the case, I don't know why I even thought you'd be equal to the task I had for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007514|I see showing respect is too much of a challenge for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007513|Keep your pledge and kiss my ass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007512|What do you want me to do?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007511|Are you ready for that challenge?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007510|That honor must be earned.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007509|Being granted the title of Paladin is a high honor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007508|You won't get far without my pledge.|Both options lead into this line
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007507|Word travels fast in this town. And it is as well that it has reached my ear.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007506|Really? And yet, as a Warlord it seems like it is very much my business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007505|That is my business.|Answering Angrim's question above.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007504|Yes. I want to be promoted.|Answering the line above.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007503|I have heard you want to be promoted to Paladin?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007502|Lesson learned, I hope. Now, get out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007501|Profit comes before all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007500|Good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007499|I will pay the fine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007498|Now, get out of there before I think of something worse.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007497|Save the talk. You've been told the choice and the consequences.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007496|You don't like to get your own hands dirty?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007495|People who don't pay will find bounty hunters on their trail until the day they find the shards they owe.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007494|For this count, I'll forbid all the merchants in the city from trading with you until you've made payment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007493|So, you're challenging me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007492|Those are your options.|Stress on those.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007491|That's not an option. You pay with Elexit, or you'll pay with pain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007490|You're not punishing me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007488|We have no space for empty pockets in this place. Earn the shards and pay the fine. And, make it fast.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007487|I can't pay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007486|Now, get out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007485|The Fort is about profit. You need to keep the profit coming in if you are to stay here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007484|I will pay my fine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007483|Either, pay a fine, or face the consequences.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007482|You are wanted here, murderer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007481|You are wanted here, thief.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007480|You are wanted here after your attacks on our people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007479|You have broken the codes of the Fort, and must face punishment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007478|Hey!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007477|You are dismissed. Go to your duties.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007476|And make sure you break no more of our laws|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007475|You are free to go, but step carefully.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007474|Then penance will have been paid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007473|I want to pay my fine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007472|Now leave my sight.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007471|I'd recommend you make the payment soon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007470|Run and a bounty will be placed on your head. Death will follow until the day you return to pay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007469|Your offenses are too severe for me to let you simply walk away.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007468|No trader will sell to you until your fine is paid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007467|You don't have a choice. You made your choice when you broke the law.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007466|I'm not paying a fine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007465|Make sure you return here soon to make payment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007464|Well, a postponement may be granted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007463|I don't have enough shards to pay my fine.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007462|You are free to go, but step carefully and make sure you break no more of our laws.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007461|Then penance will have been paid.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007460|I will pay my fine.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007459|Judgment has been passed and a payment is due. Pay this fine, or face the punishment that follows.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007458|You stand accused of murder.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007457|You are accused of theft of Berserker property.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007456|You are accused of assault and of causing injury to our citizens.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007455|I have heard the accusations and the evidence and passed judgement on you.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007454|Halt! You are wanted here, you must answer for your crimes.|Seeing the player character. Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007441|But, don't take too long, or justice will find you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007440|Do not make the same mistake again. You are dismissed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007439|Shards are one way to make good the damage you have caused, but it will not ease the ill feeling.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007437|You are dismissed. May Calaan be with you always.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007436|Please, report to our armor master before you go out into the world. You should claim what you have earned.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007434|And, with a punch like yours, well, I'm glad we've got you on our side.|False jolly. Strained and hoping not to get hit.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007432|Well, good. Welcome to the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007431|I think it is about time I got out of here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007430|If you hadn't given me up to Jora I would still be doing well here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007429|Yet here you are. Berserker clothes on a hollow man.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007426|Yet here I am.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007425|You can't be a Berserker without understanding Berserker Law.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007424|Welcome to the Berserkers!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007423|Here, it's on the house.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007422|Lucky for us too. We need warriors after the battle at the Converter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007421|Look. Some idiot let this guy become one of us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007420|And, I thank you for standing by your word. That speaks loudly in your favor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007419|For my part, I will give you my pledge if you ask Ragnar for a promotion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007418|Your debt to me is paid in full.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007417|You have shown strength and trust.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007416|Zerwas is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007415|Serve the Law. Kill Zerwas and return here when the deed is done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007414|Justice must be met, but this time it must be done in silence. No one can know of his betrayal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007413|Follow him out beyond our walls and kill him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007412|I have sent Zerwas to complete a task.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007411|If he'd left to join the Outlaws that would've been more honest. I didn't choose this fate for him. He knew the risk when he decided to steal and he took that choice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007410|Duty Master is one of the most trusted tasks in Goliet. I put my faith in Zerwas and in return he betrayed us all for his personal gain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007409|Does Zerwas have to die?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007408|It's not an easy thing I ask. I want Zerwas dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007407|It's not an easy thing I ask. I want Zerwas dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007406|Good. A man's word is important.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007404|Zerwas betrayed that trust. I ask that you keep your word and do your duty where he could not.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007403|But, trust and duty are the only things that keep us together.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007402|A death should never be looked on lightly, I understand that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007401|No. I don't kill people to order.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007400|That depends on what you ask.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007399|I'll keep my word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007398|Will you keep your word?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007397|I am calling in that favor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007396|You owe me a favor, from speaking up when you wished to join the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007395|That depends entirely on you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007394|You have my pledge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007393|You should be more careful in your tasks. Be that as it may.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007392|Even if you miscounted...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007391|You did what I requested.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007390|He will be dealt with, but this isn't your concern any longer.|This follows 79,5/1 ("What will happen now with Zerwas") in some cases.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007388|I hope you failed in your task and this wasn't an attempt at deception.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007387|He must have kept something for himself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007386|The amount he gave me was far too small.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007385|You must have miscounted when you followed Zerwas.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007384|Incomer! I want to speak to you!|Called out
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007383|I must see that Zerwas faces judgement. Come back in a day's time and you will have my pledge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007382|And you will have my pledge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007381|Come back in a day's time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007379|Alright, what will happen to Zerwas?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007378|You have carried out the task that was given you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007377|And why would he give more than was owed? No, that doesn't make sense. I will have to look into this further.|Unconvinced.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007376|Justice must follow. Justice must be done.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007375|To steal is bad enough, but to betray when you have been given a trusted office?|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007374|So, duty has been done. Thank you, I was wrong to doubt Zerwas, it seems he is loyal.|Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007373|He was generous. He collected less than 400 shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007372|He lied. He collected more than 400 shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007371|He was honest. He collected 400 shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007370|Is that all he collected, or has he tried to cheat me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007369|He said he collected 400 shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007368|Zerwas has returned and given me the money he collected.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007367|As you say. Thank you, you may go.|Cool, business like (he suspects Zerwas)
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007366|Yes, we're up to date now.|Positive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007365|I'm glad to hear it. 400 shards? That covers all the payments?|Fishing (not too obviously)
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007364|Oh, and Henrik accepted your request to join the Eisen clan. He says he's delighted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007363|All 400 shards.|Proud
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007362|Zerwas, you collected those outstanding taxes?|Cool, business like (he suspects Zerwas)
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007361|And, welcome to the Eisen clan. I will return to Angrim with your recommendation straight away.|Pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007360|Then two hundred thank yous it is.|Accepting the payment
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007359|Two hundred is all I've got.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007358|I will say 'Henrik is a man of good financial understanding'. Or, at least I will, if we can come to a good financial understanding.|Positive then to business
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007357|And, you spoke in my favor?|Hopeful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007356|Yes, he did. He asked me to give him my personal opinion about you.|Cheerful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007355|Yes. Did Angrim send you?|Hopeful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007354|Henrik, I've been told you want to join the Eisen clan?|Cheerful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007353|Is anything sacred to you?|Signing off
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007352|Then you should thank the Pilgrim you don't have to sit through reading Amrek's thoughts on economics.|Cheerful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007351|I don't remember Amrek's teachings screwing Berserkers out of 100 shards a week.|Surly
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007350|Only what's due under the Law.|Cheerful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007349|What do you want, Zerwas?|Surly
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007348|The Albs don't charge me taxes.|Pointed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007347|And, the Albs used to stay in the snow and ice and leave us alone.|With a shrug
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007346|300? It used to be half that.|Grumbling (not surprised)
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007345|There are three of you right? That'll be 300 shards|Avoiding the topic
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007344|You tell me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007343|You think I'm exempt from paying tax?|Fake apology
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007342|Harder when you're at this end of the collection than yours.|Resigned, hostile
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007341|100 per person. Times are hard.|Fake apology
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007340|Zerwas? How much is it this week?|Hostile
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007339|Dorian.|Cheerful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007338|Good, good, welcome.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007337|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007336|Ah, so you're the new Cultivator?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007335|Are you here to pay clan tax? If not you have the wrong person.|Businesslike.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007334|Then go. Let duty follow.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007333|Consider it done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007332|And listen well. I want to find out, once and for all, if he is cheating me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007331|Get close to him, but be inconspicuous. I need you to eavesdrop on his conversations until he returns to me. But, do it without raising suspicion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007330|Good. He should be beginning his rounds any time now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007329|I'll watch Zerwas.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007328|Do that and I will give you my pledge towards your promotion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007327|There is much to do if we are to save this world.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007326|The Albs want to feed our world into those machines, piece by piece, person by person and only we can heal it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007325|We need all the good people we can find. We lost so many in the attack on the Converter.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007324|Welcome you to our community.|Friendly

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007319|Ah, I see you've become one of us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007318|Do that and I will give you my pledge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007317|Once you've pulled the roots out bring them to the Cultivator House and throw it on the trash heap for burning.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007316|Born found some up around the small waterfalls between the fields. It must be pulled out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007315|We have a real problem with weeds here. Gralla root has been growing in our fields and choking the other plants. We thought we were rid of it, but it seems not.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007314|So, it seems I must tell you your tasks.|If Ragnar did not explain the player's duties. Mildly annoyed. He's used to this.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007313|Ah, how habits form. He had been overseer so long, it's hard to imagine he really is gone.|Remembering that Born is dead
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007312|Born is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007311|Will you recommend me for a promotion?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007310|So, tell me what are your ambitions?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007309|You could do good work here, but I feel you aren't the type to give your life to the soil.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007308|That's the gralla root dealt with.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007307|Some sort of agricultural trash heap.|Describing what he sees
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007305|Normally, a Berserker has to work on the fields for some time before promotion, but we need more Warriors.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007304|Tell me, do you want to serve as a Cultivator, or do you have other ambitions?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007303|Excellent, that will stop a lot of complaints from the Cultivators.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007302|I removed the weeds.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007301|If I ever need any help again I will be sure to let you know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007300|Here, take your reward.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007298|You did well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007297|Here. Success should be rewarded.|Giving the player a reward.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007296|Oh, good, good, thank you. If only removing them all were so simple. Horrid stuff. One day I hope we develop magic that will let us burn every last Gralla Root from the ground.|Passionate
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007295|I put the weeds on the trash pile.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007294|With your knowledge of plants, I think it is best that you stay away from the fields from now on.|Unimpressed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007293|The heap is on the left side of the cultivator house. Please, take the weeds and put them on the pile there so they can be burned.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007292|Directly to the trash pile. Directly! I don't want those weeds shedding seeds anywhere near here!|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007291|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007290|And, you brought them here? I love plants, but Gralla root... I wish the Comet had burned every last one from the planet! Take it away from here for burning. Now!|Frustrated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007289|I pulled out all the weeds around the waterfalls as you wanted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007288|What do you mean you 'have' the weeds?|Annoyed that the player brought them here.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007287|I have the weeds from the Seedling fields.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007286|And, listen carefully, take them directly to the trash pile to be burned. I don't want their seeds spreading anywhere else.|Stressing directly
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007284|Make sure you get them all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007283|Look for the weeds around the small waterfalls between the fields and rip them out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007282|If it takes hold again, we could lose the whole crop of Seedlings, so I need you to remove it. All of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007281|We have a real problem with weeds in the Seedling fields. Gralla root.|Gralla root is the name of the weed. Born hates the stuff.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007280|But, whether you want it or not, you are one of us now and I have a job for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007278|Many who change their minds once they arrive. Either way, you must prove yourself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007277|Good, good. Then we can get on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007276|Well, there's honesty, even if I don't like your intention.|Philosophical
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007275|Shards, armor and weapons, that's what I want from Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007274|There are many who feel that way when they come here.|Used to it
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007273|I didn't join the Berserkers to be a farmer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007272|Yes, I was.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007271|You were sent to me to help on the Seedling fields, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007270|The Seedling fields are the heart of everything we do here, the 'World Heart' of it all. And spending time with the soil is a good way to learn who you are.|The opening is an estbalished Culitvator 'joke'
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007269|Our new Seedling waiting a chance to grow into something else. Eying promotion already? Well, that's fair enough. But, remember.|A well used piece of Cultivator humour.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007268|Cormag sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007267|It is good to meet another new recruit.|Apologetic
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007266|Ah! Is that so?|Relaxing, pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007264|Relax, I'm a Berserker.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007263|He'll instruct you further.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007262|He's the overseer in the Seedling fields, he'll be happy to gain another helping hand.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007261|Report to Born.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007260|All our crops are needed, but the welfare of the Seedlings will be your top priority.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007259|Tend to the plants, work the soil and as you watch Magalan grow, so you will see yourself prosper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007255|All Berserkers must begin in the fields, all must grow from the seed to understand who they are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007254|Good, then let us get straight to your specific tasks.|If Ragnar explained.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007253|Very well, then I will explain them to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007252|Where in these times do you get things for free? And, why would you trust such an offer? Work, you know that is honest.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007251|You expect me to work?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007250|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007249|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007248|Did Ragnar tell you your duties as a Cultivator?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007246|An honorable and worthy rank.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007245|Ah, I see we have a new Cultivator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007243|Only Berserkers assigned to the World Heart are allowed here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007242|Halt!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007241|Their minds are already being controlled.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007239|I wish we could use it freely on the Albs, and they have proven to be resistant.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007238|That said, suggestion is a useful weapon when necessary.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007237|When necessary. But, suggestion is a tricky art and it is always better if you can persuade someone instead of manipulating their mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007236|Do you use suggestion on the other factions?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007235|Can't Albs do that, with their mutants?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007234|Their commanders are using an extreme form of brainwashing on them already.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007233|But, I think the answer is more straightforward.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007232|Others that it is because they have been poisoned....|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007231|Some say it is because they are 'strong of mind'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007226|It is an art that only the Clerics understand. |Proud
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007225|It takes training, but it means we can bring people back to the pure path, or 'suggest' to them that they do things that will assist us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007224|Through suggestion. We have developed technology, implants that allow us to guide the minds of others.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007223|How do you clear someone's mind?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007222|Only then can we be at one with Calaan and his community. As a Patriarch it is my job to guide and advise. The Will of Calaan clears the mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007221|The body pure, free of the poison of Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007220|The mind must be free from false teachings.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007219|As the High Suggestor, I assist the minds and souls of the lost to return to Calaan's way through suggestion. Calaan's will works through a skill all Clerics must learn.|Noble
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007218|The correction of those who have strayed from the path of the pure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007217|Suggestion?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007216|As the highest Suggestor I don't have much free time, as I'm sure you understand.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007215|And, we are the only ones who can end it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007214|You see...there has been war on this planet ever since that damn Comet came down, bringing Elex with it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007213|We'll have to track down all the A.I. chips of that design before more mechs go homicidal.|Worried
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007212|But, as I said, you could manage this gate with a robot. With a robot... Now, that is an idea.|Realsing the idea in this
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007211|That is why the gate up there is so well secured. Nobody will get through the gate there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007210|That will give them a nice short walk when they drag everyone our of here to throw them into the Converter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007209|Because of all the creatures there. That and when the Albs decide to attack us, that is where they will come from.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007208|Why's the Converter so dangerous?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007207|That's why I got posted to this side of the Fort. The other side. . That's where the real action is, by the Converter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007206|But recently, there've been more of those animals with machines embedded in them. You ask me it's some sort of plan by the Clerics, or the Albs to wipe us out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007204|Well, you've been out there. And everything out there, wants to get in here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007203|What kind of creatures are we talking about?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007201|Everything that clouds your judgment. Alcohol, chems, name your poison.|Cheerful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007200|What do you have to offer?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007199|I want to rewire your world. So, when I say high, I'm talking sky high!|Psychedelic man
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007198|But, you needn't worry. I don't want to take your emotions away. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007197|Now, I know what you're thinking. Elex - won't that turn me into an Alb?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007196|But, with a guaranteed Elex high.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007195|From anything that's good!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007194|What are these chems made from?|Dubious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007193|I have only the best chems made from the purest Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007192|We don't need anything like that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007191|I haven't implanted machine components in his body in order to be able to communicate with him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007190|If it was up to me, then we would make sure these Albs went somewhere else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007189|At some point if they learn that Albs are sheltering here then they might attack us even if Xacor doesn't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007187|When he's better, I'll go back to Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007186|Here. Here, take it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007185|I should give it to you. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007184|Yes, I'm putting him in danger.|Confused by the player's suggestion skill
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007183|Hand it over and they'll stop looking for you. If they keep looking, they'll find you, they'll kill your brother.|Using his suggestion skill
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007182|Until then I can't. They wouldn't understand what I'm doing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007181|I'll explain everything to Caldrim.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007180|I keep going, I can get him back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007179|It's been years of creatures and Albs and...|Emotional, relief.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007178|I thought they would be the end of me.|Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007177|As for me, I think the Free People should work together in this war with the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007176|Goliet has always opened its doors to those who need shelter, but these are hard times and war grows suspicions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007175|Welcome, Incomer, I hope you are being treated well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007174|Every Alb, every mutant, stands against nature.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007173|They tear the it out of the ground. They take plants and animals and people and feed them into their convertors!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007172|And, how do they get the Elex they're so pumped up on?|Rhetorical question
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007169|How messed up must you be to decide to do that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007168|They're like machines, killing machines.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007167|They take so much Elex, they've lost all their emotion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007166|Why do you hate the Albs so much?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007165|That means everything here has to go smoothly.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007164|And, the Hort stands as the guardian for all of Magalan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007163|It means I must ask of everyone who comes here - are you friend, or foe?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007162|Such a duty requires vigilance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007158|Sand and ruins and wreckage. So, here we get to be free. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007157|What is there to steal in Tavar? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007155|You think we're the only ones trying to take things? Albs, Clerics, Berserkers they all take what they want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007154|Why have the Outlaws stayed here in this desert?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007153|I'm in charge of this district, but he knows what is going on across the whole Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007149|I just can't get in through my head why they would fight us so hard when we are trying to make this desert inhabitable!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007148|And, we're keeping it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007145|Shove one of those in the soil and just watch the land around it grow.|Proud
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007144|But, you want to know how it works, you'll have to ask Caldrim, or someone. I just see the results.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007143|Magic, isn't it? Magic.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007142|What is Mana?|option 5.2
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007141|Unless those wretched Albs bomb everything flat first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007140|But, if we plant enough World Hearts, we'll make the whole of Magalan green again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007139|Elex poisons everything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007138|Elex poisons the ground?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007137|You feed a Seedling with Mana and when it's mature a World Heart will clean out the Elex and bring the ground to life.|Proud
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007136|All this here was wasteland till the milk of Mana came and changed it.|Proud
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007135|Heart and soul of the Berserkers they are. Magalan's very own mother's tit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007134|What are World Hearts?|option 5.1
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007133|What are they? They're World Hearts.|Surprised at the question
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007132|What are Seedlings?|option 4.1
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007131|But, I wonder whether holding on to the Laws too tightly will do the same?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007130|Now, Angrim would say that giving in to technology would destroy us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007129|Just imagine if we Berserkers could enhance the Clerics' energy weapons, or the Outlaws' explosives with the power of Mana? Who could stop us then?|Both 22 and 23 lead into this one. Selling his dream
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007126|We have only just started our study of it. And the Hammer clan has made that study our purpose.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007125|And, yet, it seems so normal now doesn't it? It's hard to remember that magic is only a generation old.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007124|Well, Albs are normally pasty white.|Considering the player character, suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007123|But, as Amrek said 'technology is seduction, the easy path will lay us waste'. And, so here we are - removing temptation from the weak-minded.|Quoting Amrek
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007122|Not everyone understands what we do here, particularly Incomers.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007114|As I have already explained...I oversee the Mana shrine here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007113|Very good. I hope a lesson has been learned.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007112|I want to pay my fine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007110|You pay with shards, or you pay with your life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007109|And, a bounty will be placed with the justice seekers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007108|Defiance comes with a cost. No trader here will deal with you until you have paid your compensation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007106|Then come back when you have enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007105|I won't pay any fine.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007095|Let me guess, I'm not allowed into the upper quarter?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007094|Hey you!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007093|Get out of our house! There is nothing for you here! Nothing!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007092|So, that's what we do here. We work with nature. Nature gives us Mana and Mana gives us magic.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007091|Nature is magic. Real magic. Took the Comet for people to realize that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007089|Yes. Yes, I can trade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007081|I can't understand why I ever thought Artag was my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007080|Let the Albs work for themselves. This makes us look like barbarians.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007079|They have received their just punishment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007078|Albs are not taken captive, they are killed.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007031|Hey, I tell you what, I'll add a sweetener.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007030|And, don't make the same mistake and try and fight again.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007028|No. I'm not paying.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007005|The Hort suffered an attack by mutants about a week ago. They came from the north, or northeast and the survivors returned that way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007004|You take the next step of the journey and show your commitment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007003|How can I earn something for myself around here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007002|You're dismissed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00007000|Understood?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006999|Kill any mutants, and all Albs you find. Secure that deposit so we can exploit it ourselves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006998|I want you to leave immediately and secure it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006997|A new Elex deposit has been discovered. This is where the mutants are massing to attack the Hort.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006994|Attention!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006993|I found out where the mutants are coming from.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006992|But, I need the A.I. chips from those combat mechs.|Stressed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006991|I'll see if I can get any answers from this unit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006990|What did I tell you?! We've got more malfunctions! If this keeps happening I'm going to have to shut down all recent units and that will leave the Hort wide open. |Alarmed, hurrying the player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006989|Hurry it up, before the whole Hort is fighting itself!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006988|I need a the A.I. chips from those combat units back as soon as you can get them!|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006986|Right, I'd better find out what went wrong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006985|Here, take this and get out of here.|Irritated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006984|Remind me, why were you even let into Hort?|Irritated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006983|What else would I expect from an Outlaw?|Irritated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006982|Of course you do.|Irritated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006981|I'm sorry and thanks for your help.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006977|Please, give me the chips.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006976|Still, enough talk, I'd better analyze these and find how we can stop anything else going wrong...|Beginning to think of the task ahead, edge of worry.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006973|Well, let's see if these can help us save some. Thanks for bringing them back.|Pulling herself together
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006972|You're late, that's cost us lives. |Upset
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006971|Get me those A.I. chips and make it fast will you? Fast like, I need those chips now!|Worried
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006970|If this is a problem with the A.I. chip design...|Worried
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006969|And, I hope it's just one batch that's affected....|Worried
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006968|Good. I hope I'm right about this.|Worried
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006967|Okay, I'll bring you the A.I. chips.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006966|Thanks for bringing these back. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006965|I'd better find the error in these chips before we get any more casualties.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006964|Dammit, I said we shouldn't have sent engineers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006963|I'm afraid they're both dead.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006961|Did you find the recovery team?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006960|You have? Excellent. Give them here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006959|Listen, I have the A.I. chips from the combat mechs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006958|Concrete runway to the west. Got it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006957|An old airstrip where planes used to...that doesn't matter. It's a big concrete 'road'. Head out of the Hort and go west. You'll find it.|Starting to explain a runway then getting back to the point?
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006956|Great, thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006953|Runway?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006948|So, there's a good chance they're still there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006947|Well...The recovery team said they'd found the mechs out by the Old World runway.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006946|I'll find those mechs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006945|And, if these coordinates are wrong?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006944|Not if everything else is malfunctioning.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006943|Now, I'm not promising their trackers are working.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006942|Let me upload their location beacons to your adjutor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006941|But, as far as I know they only got a short distance from the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006940|They were supposed to be on a trial run out to the border with Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006939|Well...|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006938|And, please, look out for that recovery team I sent. Those guys are better in a workshop than they are in the wild. I'd be obliged if you could bring 'em back alive.|Concerned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006937|So, can you scrap these mechs and bring me their Al chips?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006936|And, that will be everyone's problem. Including yours.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006935|But, if this issue is a problem with the way we're manufacturing AI chips, we're going to get malfunctions everywhere.|Persuasive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006934|Look, this is just one combat squad...|Persuasive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006933|I should've known you'd ask that.|Disappointed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006932|What's my help worth?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006931|But, I need someone to go out there and get the chipsets so I can check them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006930|It's probably a faulty batch of Al chips, that's my guess.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006929|There's another squad of mechs due off the assembly line and I need to know what's gone wrong before they go haywire too.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006928|I've got to find out what happened to the recovery party and what's gone wrong with those mechs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006927|I sent a recovery party to attempt a reset, but they're late making their report.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006926|They're refusing remote shutdown and are attacking anything that moves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006925|A squad of combat mechs has gone haywire.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006924|For the record, I just fit the chips, it's not my fault if some clean room priss managed to screw up a whole batch of chips.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006923|You made the problem. You fix it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006922|Where can I find these mechs?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006921|What do you need help with?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006920|Well, you see...|Resigned to the fact she needs to ask for help
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006919|What's that to you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006918|If you can handle yourself, I could use your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006917|So, you Berserkers better have improved your magic. Say, no offense meant. You must be able to look after yourself to have got here.|A friendly jibe then moving towards asking a favour
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006915|I have taken the pledge and am a Berserker. Magalan will grow strong again thanks to the World Hearts.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006914|I am an Outlaw and will remain one.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006912|We are all Free People. Even an Outlaw can benefit from the light of Calaan. May wisdom find you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006911|Why did you come here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006909|Don't you use the power of mumbo jumbo instead?|Mocking
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006908|What's the point in teaching Berserkers how to use an Elex weapon?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006907|You'll have to find someone else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006906|I don't teach Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006905|Halt, stranger. Not another step.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006904|Halt, Berserker. Not another step.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006903|Not least because you'll do yourself an injury.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006902|Say, how well do you know the area outside the Hort? I guess you can take care of yourself if you've managed to make it here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006901|Whatever brings you to the Hort...welcome, I guess.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006900|They were old Type T5's though. We've made a lot of improvements since then.|Recalling history. An admission.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006899|Hey, no need to get riled. And, well yeah...I did hear some Berserker once took out a whole chapter of Mechs on his own.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006898|Have you ever seen Berserkers use magic?|Implying that magic is better than technology.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006897|Don't you reject technology? I mean come on, that is a bit backwards isn't it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006896|This is the last place I'd expect to see a Berserker.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006895|Please, keep your eyes and hands off the equipment. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006894|What are you doing here?|Surprised to see someone.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006893|A visitor?|Surprised to see someone wandering in.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006891|I'd better go and report Leopold's death to Anna at the Hort. We only came out here on a repair job and now...he's dead. |Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006890|That's all the mechs taken care of, thank goodness. I was sent out here to repair them, or bring their A.I. chips back to the Hort.|Calming down after the battle, still jittery
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006889|Thank you for your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006888|We'd better not stand talking, there are combat mechs round here and they're out to kill us.|Worried
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006887|Can I do anything else for you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006886|I am grateful I got my goods back. You should be glad you got a chance to walk around the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006885|No, no, my friend. I think I did the right thing. I saved you from your own suspicious mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006884|Then you'd never have taken the deal. Which means...you'd never have got into the Hort.|Reasonable
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006883|You could have told me the permit was counterfeit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006882|I don't owe you anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006881|No, I gave you what you asked for.|Defiant
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006880|Are you serious? You want to be paid because I helped you get into the Hort?|Defiant
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006879|Do you need something else?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006878|I know what I'm doing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006877|You see...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006876|I wanted a valid permit. No permit means you owe me shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006875|All right...the permit did help me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006874|So, you wanted in and you got in - deal done.|Defiant
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006873|But, I'll bet he didn't spot it at the gate did he? I'll bet that permit got you into the Hort first!|Proud
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006872|Xander spotted it?|Disappointed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006871|The permit you gave me was counterfeit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006870|Have a good day.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006869|We will sort things out then.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006868|Right, I can't talk about it now, you will have to come back and catch up with me later.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006867|Okay. I'll do this favor for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006866|Here, take your permit and have a good day.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006865|A sensible choice, play by the rules and you will avoid trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006864|I will pay for a new permit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006863|Otherwise... I could do with a favor. Promise to help me with that and I'll let you back in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006862|I've spoken to the Legate in charge and he said we could issue you a new permit if you cooperated. That will cost 500 Shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006861|But, seeing as you seem to have been tricked into this deception I will help you sort this out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006860|Levin...Well, I'll have to speak to him then, won't I?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006859|Well, whatever you were told, it's definitely a fake.|Sceptical
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006858|I got it from a trader named Levin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006857|I was told it was a genuine trading permit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006856|Not a bad one, but definitely counterfeit. So, let's start with where you got it from and how you got it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006855|Your trading permit was inspected, it's a damn forgery!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006854|Hey you!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006853|Good. Then, I'll explain the rules for entry before you get yourself in trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006852|Let me explain the rules you will need to follow here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006851|You will be expelled from the Hort. Why? Do you know there is something wrong with it? If so, maybe you should stay out here. If not...|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006850|What if there is something wrong with the permit?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006849|Okay. You have a deal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006848|You'll get it back once it's been checked out. If there aren't any problems with it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006847|It's standard regulations.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006846|You may enter the Hort, but I will have to keep hold of this permit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006845|Well, it looks in order.|Still suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006844|Come, show me this permit of yours.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006843|You? Where did you get a trading permit? I've never seen you here before.|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006842|I have a trading permit. Let me through.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006841|See you around.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006840|If you need more you can find me in Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006839|Here. You can have them. And, some ammunition. I'll bet you get through a lot of that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006838|Of course you do. Those locked crates got you curious, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006837|I will go to the Hort. If you want something you'll find me there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006836|And, just let me know if you want to trade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006835|Yeah, sure! Of course!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006834|Good luck, I'll see you in the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006833|Yes, yes! You've got it!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006832|Head northwest then follow the road west from there and you'll find them for sure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006831|I want some of those goods I recovered.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006830|I'll take the shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006829|Give me the trading permit for the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006828|So, what can I do for you? Shards? A trading permit for the Hort? A discount on goods? You name it!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006827|Yes! That's what I needed. Damn it, I am back in business!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006826|Yes. Is this what you lost?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006825|You did? You did!|Excited, pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006824|I think I found your goods.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006823|Finally, a break! Right!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006822|Yeah! That's it! That's it! |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006821|I'll find your goods.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006820|So, what do you think? Will you help me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006819|That would open the door, Xander will let you in for sure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006818|With a trading permit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006817|How can you help me get into the Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006816|Think about it, all right? I can make it worth it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006815|Fuck! What? When am I going to get a break?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006814|Not interested.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006813|Then, you want shards? I can sort that if you can get me the goods.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006812|I've already been to the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006811|Fuck it. This was supposed to be my pay day. But, if you can help me, it could still be and in return...I can get you into the Hort. How about that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006810|Unless, some Outlaw has taken them back to the Fort already.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006809|You don't have any goods?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006807|Where can I find these goods?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006804|The men are dead, but the goods are sitting out there just waiting to be picked up.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006803|Guess how that good idea went?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006802|The caravan that was bringing them went straight through 'ripper' country in the middle of breeding season.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006801|No. It was a total fuck up.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006794|I was. Because, you know what a trader needs? Goods!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006793|You're a trader?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006792|How am I supposed to 't-r-a-d-e' trade without goods?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006790|Goods. Goods! What the hell else of would I want?!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006789|Want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006788|What is it you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006787|What goods?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006786|You brought me the goods, I mean that's why you're talking to me right? You have the goods...? Where are the goods?|Anxious then the last sentence, realising the player has nothing with them.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006785|Xander has told me to blacklist you. I don't know what you did to get him angry, but he is angry!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006784|I am sorry. I can't trade with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006783|Do you have anything to trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006782|Take care of your trouble with Xander first. I'll trade with you then.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006781|Maybe you should find a way to get on his good side. I'll trade with you then. Okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006780|And, I need him on my side, I can't afford for him to bar me from the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006779|Xander forbade me to trade with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006778|So, you know... The thing is...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006777|What have you got to trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006776|You're speaking my language.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006775|Let's trade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006774|Wherever you are going, stay safe on your travels.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006773|That is what I want to hear.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006772|I don't train people in the basics. You need to be part of this faction - understood?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006771|Well, then you're no concern of mine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006770|Understood.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006769|I'm not an Initiate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006768|The factory guards patrol to the north, by the mech production facilities.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006767|Have you been to the mine? If not you will find it to the west, below the Cathedral.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006766|Then there is the mine guard and the factory guard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006765|Well, there's Xander, he was on duty at the main gate in the night in question.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006764|Where can I find these guards?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006762|I hope to see you at my next sermon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006761|I thank you for helping me to return to the path of the righteous.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006760|And, I have re-devoted my life to Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006759|I saw the error of my ways.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006758|The Suggestors saw the strength of my faith. I did not require correction.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006757|And, I shall atone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006756|My faith is pure again. I know I have made mistakes.|He is under suggestion, so a little robotic. He doesn't believe he has been suggested
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006755|What punishment? I have merely had my faith strengthened. Calaan is just, I am at one with Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006754|I don't know what you mean. I serve Calaan and Calaan will protect me from the unworthy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006753|So, you accept your punishment for dealing chems?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006752|Have you been re-educated?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006751|Welcome Calaan into your heart. His path will lead all to enlightenment.|Soft, pious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006750|Now, I will act only because of Suggestion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006749|I gave my life of my own free will and now I will no longer know that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006748|I dedicated my life to Calaan and this is how I end up?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006747|Don't act like you don't know.|Angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006746|You were the preacher here, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006745|Hey you! Weren't you running around trying to find out who was dealing chems?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006744|You will pay for your sins, Calaan knows and he will punish you! For all I did, this one thing...for all I did!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006743|My good name! After all I have done, now I will be sent for suggestion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006742|Admit it, it was you who besmirched my good name.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006741|You asked me what I know about the chem dealing. So, it must be you who accused me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006740|You? It was you. Admit it!|Challenging the player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006739|Please... I don't want to be forced by suggestion. I won't fall under Calaan's will!|Begging
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006738|Okay, then let me know what you have to trade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006737|Let's do some business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006736|Well, I might not be a trader, but I suppose I could do some trading, for a few things.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006735|You don't have anything to trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006734|Trade? Do I look like a trader? No, I don't have anything to trade.|Confused, not insistent.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006733|Do you have anything to trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006732|Is there anything I can do make things up with you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006731|Then I guess I should apologize for...you know...getting cranky with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006730|I mean... Okay...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006729|But... I...that nose... Are you sure it wasn't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006728|You are mistaken.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006727|But, I would bet that it was you, I recognize you...I think...I think I do....|Confused under the influence of suggestion.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006726|So, what do you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006725|But, don't think we're suddenly going to be best buddies, or anything, okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006724|Hmm... Well, that's, you know...not totally shit of you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006723|You should know that I didn't accuse you. It was someone else.|Using suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006722|I have something here for you that will change your mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006720|Stuff them somewhere painful. |Nervous
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006719|Well, you can take your accusations and stuff them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006718|Hey. You're the one who told Reinhold that I was dealing chems!|Angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006717|And, was it lying on someone you'd just killed?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006716|If that is what you would wish to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006715|If you can find the guilty parties here in Hort, then that would open the way for you to join the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006714|And, we are in your debt.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006713|Yes, he informed me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006712|I helped Dietrich find the men behind the chem dealing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006711|So be it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006710|But, remember, devoting yourself to Calaan is a life choice. You must turn your back on the other factions. So, are you sure that you want to become a Cleric?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006709|Yes. I want to become a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006708|Have you made a decision?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006707|If you are ready, I will name you an Acolyte of Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006706|And, we need to add more good men into our ranks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006705|But, that aside, you proved you are ready to act in Calaan's name.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006704|That matter with Dietrich was good work. Finding the men behind the chem dealing was the highest priority.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006702|You would?|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006701|I would like to become an Acolyte of the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006700|Consider us square.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006699|I don't know how that slipped my mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006698|Yes...yes...I remember.|Falling under the power of suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006697|You remember. You remember telling me that the debt was cleared.|Using his suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006696|You did? But...when was that...?|Falling under the power of suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006695|You must have forgotten, I already paid the debt to you.|Using his suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006694|Yes, this will do nicely. Consider us square.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006693|I mean, your first step could be to report me to Reinhold, but I suspect you wouldn't get very far with that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006692|Aaah. I see we are starting to speak the same language.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006691|How about this?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006690|Carry on!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006689|So...well, what else can we think of?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006688|I could ask you to help me with something, but you don't seem to keep such arrangements.|Assessing the player character, dubious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006687|That all depends what you're prepared to do for it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006686|How do I persuade the merchants here to start trading with me again?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006684|And, we didn't need an chem dealer peddling his poison here...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006683|A pity, but every man must make his choice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006682|But, it seems my offer wasn't attractive enough for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006681|It was nice doing business with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006680|Here's the payment as promised.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006679|It will be a lesson to Siegfried. Thanks a lot for your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006678|But, with one dealer put away, I'm sure Reinhold will find someone else is dealing, but...that investigation will have to wait.|As in, he knows the real culprit hasn't been arrested.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006677|Very good. I am sure Siegfried will have learned he shouldn't mess with my business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006676|Sorry about that, but a man has to keep his reputation.|Calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006675|I will tell all of my trading friends to cease trading with you.|Calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006674|And, you didn't tell him it was Siegfried.|Put out.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006672|You promised you would take care of business for me, so, your debt is paid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006671|A menace has been removed and made safe and the traders in the Hort know that I am a man to listen to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006669|And, I hear that Siegfried was the dealer. That's a real surprise, who would have thought it?|Acting this out, please Siegfried was accused.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006668|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006667|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006666|So, you told Reinhold who you suspect is dealing chems?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006665|Good luck.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006664|I think reading that will show you the wisdom of simply reporting Siegfried now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006663|Here's the report I've compiled. This is as far as I'd got with my personal investigation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006662|A wise decision. Justice will be done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006661|And, I'll make sure you're thanked for that noble choice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006660|I hope to hear you've done the right thing and accused him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006659|Proof? Well, I'm sure you'll find it. But, you can save yourself a job and have Siegfried sent for reeducation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006658|If I find out you didn't...Well, I'm sure we don't need to consider that possibility.|Threatening
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006657|But, the decision is up to you. If I find out that you accused Siegfried then I will be satisfied.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006656|It goes without saying I will pay you for helping out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006655|All right, I'll tell Reinhold that Siegfried is the dealer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006654|No. I'm not accusing Siegfried without proof.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006653|A wise decision. Justice will be done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006652|All right, I'll tell Reinhold that Siegfried is the dealer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006651|I don't think you'll make that choice. That wouldn't be helpful for anyone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006650|And, what if I don't do that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006649|So, I want you to report back that this trader, Siegfried is the dealer. Say he's guilty, job done. And, I'll know you've done the Hort a favor.|Stress on the I as the player will be doing Xander a favour here.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006648|Trust me the Hort doesn't need traders selling unregulated goods.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006647|He's a cagey guy, doesn't share his business, he needs re-education.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006645|There's a trader here who is being troublesome.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006644|Before I give you my report about the suspects...I'd like to make you an offer.|Building up to asking for a favour.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006642|He's a cagey guy, doesn't share his business, he needs re-education. So, you can report back that it's him, job done. Turning him in will help you and help me too.|Getting round to a hint, he wants to call in his favour.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006641|So, there you are.|Seeing he's right, Siegfried is a suspect
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006640|He's a suspect isn't he?|Raising the question
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006639|Why Siegfried of all people?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006638|Why should I do that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006637|Well, I'm calling that in. I want you to tell Reinhold that Siegfried is the chem dealer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006635|Remember, you promised to take care of some business for me? You owe me a favor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006634|Well, that works well for both of us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006633|Well, take a look at this. Reinhold has sent you to investigate, has he?|Surprised
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006632|What do you know about the chem dealing here in the Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006631|Let us hope this line of investigation produces something concrete.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006630|And, so we are relying on getting reports from the guards that can help us place who was where on the night in question.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006629|The user involved though, well, he's no longer in a position to provide us with useful information.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006628|But, in this case the user let slip the time of the deal. So, we've been working backwards from there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006627|Well, these cases are difficult. Once you find someone who has lapsed into use they rarely give up the culprit for hope of keeping their supply.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006626|Are there any more details you can tell me about the chem dealing?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006625|That's all I know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006624|Here is my report on the suspects.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006623|Oh, well, I suppose he knows what he's doing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006622|Judicator Reinhold sent you to look into this?|Surprised the player character has been selected for this.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006621|Judicator Reinhold sent me. I am supposed to have a look at your reports from the time of the crime.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006620|How do you know about that?|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006619|I want to ask you some questions about the chem trade here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006618|Thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006617|All that I know is there, maybe it will help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006616|That's exactly who I wrote up in my report.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006615|Siegfried, Hagen and Oswald.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006614|But, remind me, who are the chief suspects?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006613|I've all ready written the report, as ordered.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006612|So, Reinhold's brought in some more help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006611|I need to ask you some questions. About the chem dealing?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006610|Fighting is about purity. Chems are far from pure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006609|And, I don't want to be connected to it either.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006608|I know I don't have anything to do with it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006607|What do you know about the chem dealing here in Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006606|Calaan will see that they are punished. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006604|And, once the impure are led to them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006603|I know that they must be successful.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006602|Only that Judicator Reinhold and Dietrich are seeking those responsible.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006599|Have you heard anything about chem dealing here in the Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006598|No, sorry, I must have had the wrong idea about you.|Realising the player doesn't know what they are talking about.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006597|A claw? Doesn't that give you 'claws for thought'?|A terrible pun instead of 'pause'.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006596|Lie. Lie. Lie. Lie.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006595|That's a lie! A complete lie! That's more of a lie than any other lie I could think of.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006594|I'm just saying. Not that I want to indulge in prittle-prattle.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006593|His position gives him all the opportunity in the world to deal in 'illicit substances'. And, he's shady.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006592|If you want to look at someone who deserves suspicion, then look at Hagen. Hagen is definitely someone to suspect.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006591|And, you know? If this is a trick and you really do suspect me then you should know that it really, really isn't me, couldn't be me and wasn't me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006588|Thank you. Thank you. I can't believe someone would think it was me!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006587|Okay, I believe you, it's a lie.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006586|You've been accused of dealing chems here in the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006585|Claw? What are you talking about?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006584|Not without clawing some information out of someone. I mean if you were to claw it out of me then, okay, but otherwise.... I won't say anything more about it.|Making a pun out of the word claw
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006583|Well, you know, it's what I want to know too. And, I don't know anything about it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006582|That's what I want to know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006581|What should I know about it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006580|What do you know about the chem dealing here in Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006579|Well, please tell me who you think is responsible.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006578|And yet, you still think you can name a suspect?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006577|No. I haven't spoken to them yet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006576|Then, I might allow you to join our faction as an Acolyte.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006575|Help Dietrich find the men behind the chem dealing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006574|I will give you a chance to redeem yourself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006573|Come back to me when you have decided to dedicate your life to Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006572|And, I will give you the chance to join us, to become a Cleric as an Acolyte.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006571|But, since you were able to find the men behind the Elex dealing with Dietrich, I will turn a blind eye.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006570|Since you didn't manage to find the chem dealers don't expect any sort of reward.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006569|Siegfried can't have been responsible for that deal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006568|But, it seems you were wrong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006567|You accused Siegfried of dealing chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006566|Do that and I will look past that fact you accused the wrong person.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006565|Go and help Dietrich find whoever really is behind the chem dealing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006564|I will give you another chance to prove yourself.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006563|Report to me when you are ready to become an Acolyte.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006562|But, since you and Dietrich found the man responsible for chem dealing, I would like to give you opportunity to join us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006561|You should think twice before putting someone in that place again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006560|It is a good job we were able to determine this before he was punished for a crime he hadn't committed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006559|Hagen can't be the man we are looking for.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006558|But, it appears you are wrong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006557|You accused Hagen of dealing chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006556|Complete this task and I would be willing to let you join the Clerics as an Acolyte.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006555|Go and speak to Dietrich. He is looking for the men behind the chem dealing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006554|Let me know when you have made your decision.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006553|If you are ready to join us, I will name you as an Acolyte of the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006552|You really proved yourself reliable. I hope you decide to stay here in the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006551|Here is the reward that was promised.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006550|I thank you for your work and for helping us rid the Hort of this chem dealing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006549|He is the guilty party.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006548|And, further investigation has proven that you were correct.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006547|You accused Oswald of dealing chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006546|I must speak with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006545|And, you shall receive the promised reward when that happens.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006544|If he is really the suspect then he will receive a just punishment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006543|Thank you for your work. I will investigate this further.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006539|This is a serious accusation you are making. I hope you understand the consequences of this accusation for him and for you.|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006536|Oswald acts like a pious, Calaan-fearing person, but there is something... strange about him. Maybe this explains his behavior.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006531|I hope you understand the consequences of this accusation for him and for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006530|This is a serious accusation you are making against a good man.|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006529|It must have been Siegfried who made that deal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006528|I suspect Hagen.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006527|I think it was Oswald.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006526|That would be wise.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006525|No. I had better review the evidence before making an accusation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006524|So, you have already spoken to the three guards and collected their reports?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006523|I think I know who the Chem dealer is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006519|Try and get that information as a written report. Anecdote and memory are best not relied on in these cases.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006518|You should speak with the guards who were on duty at the time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006517|He can explain his methodology to you, but as I recall it was a simple process of rejecting anyone who lacked the requisite access and opportunity.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006516|Dietrich said his investigation had eliminated everyone apart from Oswald, Hagen and Siegfried. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006515|You should start with them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006514|Did Dietrich say why he suspected these three?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006513|Who does Dietrich suspect?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006512|To my knowledge he had slimmed the investigation down to three suspects.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006511|Well, I had given Dietrich the task of investigating them, but he doesn't seem to have much luck so far. You should check what leads he has.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006509|If you think you can find these dealers, I would welcome your insight.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006508|A large reward has been offered to anyone able to bring them to justice. That should prevent this from becoming a bigger problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006507|Yes?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006506|Do you have any leads on where they may be operating?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006505|About the Chem dealers here in Hort...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006504|Complete this task and you will open the door to becoming a Cleric, a true warrior for Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006503|They are a problem that must be eliminated.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006502|But, those who deal in misery, who exploit the weakness of others...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006501|Every one of us suffers temptation and all must hope they can prevail against it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006500|We've recently had to deal with the sad deaths of some of the faithful who...wandered. Wandered right into the arms of an chem dealer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006499|I could use the help of someone who hasn't had time to establish themselves here, someone with a more 'objective' viewpoint.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006498|Each man must choose his own path. I hope you change your mind. But...in the meantime, perhaps you could assist me in something..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006497|Each man must choose his own path. I hope you change your mind. But...in the meantime, perhaps you could assist me in something..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006496|As you wish.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006495|I'm not sure, I would like to think about it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006494|I am not interested in becoming a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006493|I am ready. Give me a task.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006492|And, every Acolyte that joins us, can then begin on the path of enlightenment to gain promotion here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006491|And, should they complete the tasks that are given to them, then I would welcome them into our community.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006490|Initiates are only allowed to join us when I decide they are worthy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006489|Correct.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006488|So, you decide who becomes a Cleric and who doesn't?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006487|We can only pray that we too might serve Calaan with such honor as he did.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006486|Calaan has accepted him and he shall see the Infinite Skies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006485|I regret to inform you that Judicator Ulbricht, has fallen in the heroic struggle against the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006484|Then you have taken a step on the right path, but a step is only the start of a journey, not its end.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006483|I have completed my initiation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006482|Focus, fitness and fighting strength, that's what counts in life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006481|Only the purest, strongest and smartest can train with me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006479|Body, mind and spirit combining into the finest fighting force.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006478|I teach the 'art' of fighting.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006477|I am Paladin Hagen and I teach more than combat.|Stressing his rank
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006476|So, you are a combat instructor?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006475|You must want to understand the art of combat, not just the brutality of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006474|You must want to commit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006473|And, even then, I choose who I train.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006472|I only train Acolytes and above.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006471|How can I train here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006470|If I see you running around with an unholstered weapon, you're going to get a very painful weapons safety lesson.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006469|If you are here to train with me then forget it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006468|You have to earn the right to train here, Initiate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006467|Calaan will take the pure into the promised land. |Devout
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006466|We must trust in Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006465|Only the pure will be taken up into the Infinite Skies. Only under the Infinite Skies will we truly see all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006464|Now, if we are to survive the dangers that are yet to come we must listen to the words of Calaan and hear his wisdom.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006463|But, they would not listen. And, so the Comet destroyed the civilization that was here on Magalan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006462|And, so Calaan came to the people and promised if they did this, if they worked together to follow the path to the Infinite Skies then he would save them from the horror that was to come.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006461|Each must seek the purity of knowledge. Each must seek out the strongest, the fittest, the brightest.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006460|They must reject the distractions of the world and give themselves over to the pursuit of knowledge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006459|He received the teachings of Calaan in whispers and tried to warn the people of Magalan of the horror that was to come.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006458|Before the Comet burned the face of Magalan. The prophet Arvid foresaw the danger. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006457|Tell me more about Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006456|Act in his name and he will strike down your enemies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006455|Calaan sees all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006454|Your dedication will be rewarded.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006453|I will.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006451|Keep your mind clear, your spirit strong and Calaan will protect you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006450|I see that. But, it doesn't mean you can't live according to the teachings of the Prophet Arvid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006449|Then, I am sure you will make the correct decision.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006448|You should learn what Calaan offers all of us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006447|Then you turn your back on not only Calaan, but on your own future.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006446|I'm glad you decided to join us, the path of Calaan will lead all Magalan to safety.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006445|Hah, a follower with a sense of humor. Calaan has wisdom and a light spirit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006444|I have already made my choice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006443|Not interested.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006442|Open yourself to this opportunity. Give yourself over to the teachings of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006441|Your presence here can only mean that Calaan's light shines upon you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006440|Welcome to the Hort, the stronghold of the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006439|And, so, another stray comes to seek safety in the arms of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006438|Let your belief not falter, let your strength hold back the impure, let us be at one with Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006437|In numbers, in strength, we will prosper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006436|Find and welcome those fit to be held in the arms of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006435|The faithful must grow, the word must be spread.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006434|Your mind must be clear, and your soul pure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006433|The Prophet gave to us the holy writings of Calaan. Follow them and you will be welcome in the arms of Calaan. Follow them and you will see the Infinite Skies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006432|Hear his words and take them to your heart.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006431|Only Calaan can lead you to safety. Calaan is the only shield your soul shall find.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006430|The Prophet Arvid warns of the Apocalypse that will come.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006429|Only those with a pure body, a focused mind and a strong spirit will be saved by Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006428|Do not allow yourselves to be led astray by the temptations of Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006427|Calaan's strength lies in purity.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006425|Carry Calaan in your heart, let yourselves be his instruments.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006424|All who have faith will be saved.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006423|Faith will triumph.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006422|Faith is pure|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006421|The dam in Abessa has been recaptured from the Albs and is in the hands of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006420|But, Calaan's guiding hand has saved us from this destruction. Give thanks! Praise be to Calaan!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006419|From the ruins of the Old World, they had built a war machine intended to destroy our stronghold.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006418|The Outlaws of Tavar had plotted our destruction.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006417|Be thankful to Calaan!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006416|And, welcome him back among his brethren.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006415|We give thanks for his safe homecoming.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006414|The Cleric Bertram has returned to our side.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006413|May the people of Calaan never go hungry. May they feast upon the gifts he has given us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006412|Calaan gave us the strength to take the farm from those who would keep its bounty from us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006411|The farmland that Calaan had promised us in Abessa has been seized for the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006410|Stand firm, people of Calaan, stand firm and keep to the path of the pure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006409|We did not save their souls, but instead allowed their disease of heresy to spread, tempting and ruining others. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006408|This is a punishment to us all. For we suffered the impure to live amongst us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006407|There was an uprising in the Domed City of Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006406|Show our brother that he has chose wisely. Share with him the warmth and wisdom that Calaan offers us all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006405|Calaan has welcomed a new Acolyte into our numbers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006404|And, that path leads only to destruction. To shame, to a betrayal of the purity Calaan asks of us all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006403|There are those who give into chems, to Elex, to greed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006402|And, sadly, there are those who give into that temptation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006401|For when honor fails, temptation takes charge of us. Calaan tests us all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006400|There are impure among us. Be careful of the friends you take, be wary of the temptations that others offer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006399|Listen to me, disciple of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006398|With Calaan watching us, we are never truly alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006397|I have stuff to do. See you around.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006396|I mix things. In fact, I have to get on with work, so if you've finished with the questions...?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006394|Then let me get on with straightening stuff out round here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006393|No. Tell me more about what you do here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006392|Yes|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006391|Just a simple chemist, that's all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006390|I mix things that keep the Mechs from seizing up. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006389|I'm a chemist.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006388|What are you doing here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006386|And, as you don't have the package then...we don't have anything to talk about.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006385|Nothing, well, just things I have ordered. Supplies for...the Hort.|Really bad at lying.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006384|Well, the guy with the package. That's why I asked for...the package.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006383|For...the package.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006382|Who are you waiting around here for?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006381|What's this package?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006380|What? Oh. Er, excuse me. Just forget it.|Shifty
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006379|What package?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006378|Hey, do you have my package?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006377|What can I help you with?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006376|What is you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006375|If you have something to report, speak to Judicator Reinhold.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006374|Move along there, keep clear of this area.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006373|Especially not us.|Amused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006371|You'd better listen to what I say. Don't trust anyone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006370|You go on, don't expect a second chance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006369|Others wouldn't have given you the chance to leave.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006368|Be glad you found us first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006367|Just a friendly warning. One wanderer to another.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006366|I can take care of myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006365|Thanks for the advice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006363|Doesn't matter why you're here. If you have the option. Turn around!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006362|Someone new in the Valley of the Dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006360|I had thought we were free of their vile product, but it seems we do have something of a problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006359|Is chem dealing a big problem here in the Hort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006358|Eternity, check.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006357|Abide by the words of the great Prophet Arvid and you will open your way to eternity.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006356|Stay with us and you will learn of Calaan and his ways.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006355|And, of course, your soul will pay the price.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006354|You may face a fine, re-education, or for the worst offenders, execution.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006353|Theft, physical assault, murder, the dealing of chems are all punishable offences. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006352|Well, Calaan's Commandments are simple and fair. They are rules to be found in many places, but to us, they are sacred.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006351|Explain the rules of Hort to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006350|I oversee everything in the Hort from punishment to initiation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006349|I am a Judicator. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006348|So, who are you? The welcoming committee?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006346|May your time in the Hort be peaceful and productive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006345|Your future here will depend on your ability to learn your true strength. All those who join us must seek that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006344|Good. I can see potential in you. Let us hope that this potential can be realized.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006343|Then trade, explore, meet our people while you are here and may Calaan offer you guidance as you do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006342|Then it seems Rainer was right when he saw potential in you. I hope that you can realize that potential.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006341|Then it seems Rainer was mistaken, he saw potential in you. And, it is rare for him to be wrong. I hope that you will reconsider your choice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006340|One day you must face that choice. I hope that day brings you back to us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006339|Then Calaan will welcome you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006338|But, your loyalty must stand where it has been spoken.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006337|No. You may remain here in the Hort and you can find forgiveness from Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006336|Well, if that is the case...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006334|I don't want to join a faction.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006333|Yes. I want to become a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006332|Is it possible to join you, even though I am already a member of another faction?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006331|I have already chosen my path, with another faction.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006330|Do you come here to gain the blessings of the Clerics, or to oppose us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006329|I stand watch for all those in the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006328|I am Reinhold. Judicator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006327|I know everything that happens here. So, much so that some have taken to calling me 'the Eye of Calaan'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006326|You've heard of me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006325|So, here is the wanderer I have heard about.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006324|So, here is Rainer's new Initiate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006323|Get ready. We are almost there!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006322|They must have collected loot for themselves, that's what they do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006321|Well. They're reavers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006320|What sort of loot?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006319|We don't want to hit any friendlies.|Instructions
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006318|We'll be fighting in a tight space, so watch for crossfire.|Instructions
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006317|Let's take out these damn reavers.|Stern, determined
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006316|Now, that you should give back to Albert, he needs it.|Firm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006315|I found a detonator at the fueling station.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006314|Maybe I should.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006313|After I lost it once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006312|We should hold the future safe.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006311|Yes, I think you've got a point.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006310|You should give it to someone else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006309|You should keep it on you at all times.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006308|As long as we can keep it safe this time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006305|Thank you. You could just have stopped the Albs from invading Ignadon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006304|Yes. Here it is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006303|And you've brought it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006302|I found the detonator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006301|The fueling station was supposed to be his outpost, after all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006300|Good work! You should report that to Albert.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006299|The reavers have been cleared out of your observation post.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006298|If you don't come back we will know what happened.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006297|They are under my protection.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006296|Once we have that, we will go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006295|You will have to hunt for the plants there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006294|Start down at the bridge to the left and work your way along the river.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006293|We are lucky that it grows along a river to the west of here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006291|It is a rare plant.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006290|Well, where does Troll's Leaf grow?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006289|This isn't like the unnatural connection between Albs and their mutants.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006288|I will never be sure. But, whatever it is, it is real and it affects us both.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006287|I suspect the Elex around this area here is responsible for his behavior and our feelings. |Blissful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006285|Yes. He is my friend. He protects me and I protect him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006284|Is that so? Well, my advice is to stay that way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006283|I am not a member of a faction.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006282|No, I will attack alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006281|Will you join us on this attack? With you along, I know we can do this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006280|Do you really think you can take them all on?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006279|Yes, let's begin the attack.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006278|Good luck.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006277|Let's go. Follow me!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006275|No? Well, there would be plenty of loot to be gained from the reavers, that should be encouragement enough.|Seeing it wouldn't be enough
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006274|Wouldn't knowing you've helped the Free People of Abessa be enough?|Trying it on
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006273|It's across there, at the other side of the dam.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006272|We were using it as a monitoring post until we were over run.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006271|We've not seen them leave those ruins since they took them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006270|Where are these reavers located?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006269|What would you pay me if I could solve your problem?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006268|I will take care of the reavers for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006267|And we have to do it before the Albs attack, or they discover our plan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006266|So, we have to figure out how we can force the reavers out of our fueling station so we can recapture the detonator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006265|At least for now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006264|It's probably on the table, exactly where it was left.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006263|I doubt it. They'd probably have tried to ransom it to us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006262|Do the reavers know what they have?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006261|In the panic, the detonator got left behind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006260|They caught us by surprise. A mass attack on one of our positions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006259|Right now neither of us can trigger the explosives.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006258|They can't. Like I said, it takes both detonators to blow the dam and they've only got one.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006256|How did the reavers get the detonator?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006255|What happens if the reavers detonate the bombs?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006254|Take anything you find on the reavers. You've earned it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006253|If we can hold these monitoring posts, we can hold Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006252|We will send a message to Ignadon, hopefully this time they'll send us the reinforcements we need.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006251|Calaan must have been watching over us today.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006248|The reavers are all dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006247|The problem is that in one of their raids, the reavers go their hands on the second detonator. Until we get it back, we can't trigger the dam.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006246|You see, the explosives on the dam need to be triggered by two key coded detonators so as to prevent any...accidents.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006244|Beyond their normal raiding? It's...well...one of their raids has put a hole in our plans.|Finding it hard to confess the truth.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006242|But none of this counts for anything until we can bring these reavers under control.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006241|We need the bulk of their forces in the path of the flood, not just a few scouting parties.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006240|There's no point until the Albs move into attack, we don't want to endanger innocent lives unless there's a point to it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006239|We cannot allow ourselves to be weak in the face of this enemy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006238|If we must sacrifice the few for the many then so be it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006237|This is a war for the soul of Magalan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006236|Why don't you blow the dam now and put an end to the threat?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006235|Won't flooding Abessa kill innocent people?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006234|If all else fails we'll draw them here and then blow the dam. The water will hit the Albs with the force of Calaan's fist, leaving none behind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006233|So, we'll stop them here before they can reach Ignadon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006232|Conquest is in their DNA. Power, conquest and destruction is all they want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006231|You're certain the Albs will attack you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006230|What do you mean 'buy you time'?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006229|Then we can focus our forces where they are needed and make them pay. If we bloody their noses, it will buy us time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006228|Force recon. We're keeping an eye on what's going on here in Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006227|We can't match the Albs for numbers, but if we can predict where they'll attack...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006225|Why are you here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006224|What's the problem with the reavers?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006223|If so, I could do with your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006222|Then tell me what you are doing here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006221|Are you trying to get yourself killed?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006220|Whatever makes it work, I'm guessing the Berserkers are no friends of the reavers? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006219|I'll take your word for it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006218|Our magic is based on Mana. Not on Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006217|Spying for the Warlords are you? Come to cast some of your Elex magic?|Mild suspicion, not hostile
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006216|What are you doing out here so far from Edan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006215|No, I suppose you wouldn't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006214|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006213|Really? You have proof of that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006212|I'm not a reaver.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006210|Answer now, or I'll start to think you're one of those damned reavers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006209|What are you doing out here? Are you looking to trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006208|No? Then what the seven callings of heaven are you doing out here in reaver country?|Taken aback
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006207|I wasn't sent here to reinforce you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006206|Well, you can make yourself useful by going straight back to the Hort to tell Ulbricht to send me more help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006205|Calaan preserve us, I ask for help and this is what they send me as support.|Frustrated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006204|Are you it? Are you all they're sending me?|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006201|We will hold this dam. Whatever the cost.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006200|Whatever Calaan's plan is, it will take a wiser head than mine to figure it out...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006199|Not that we have a choice I suppose.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006198|How are we supposed to hold this position now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006196|Dead? Hell, him too?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006195|Albert is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006194|And until our commander decides if we're taking the post back, or hightailing it home, our mission is on hold.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006193|So, the question is, do we stay, or do we go?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006192|But we've just lost one of our obs posts to reavers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006191|Well, we were.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006189|We are making sure the Albs don't try to attack Ignadon through Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006188|Force recon. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006187|Sounds like you don't get along too well with them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006186|We're trying to protect Magalan from Albs and they're busy setting up house with them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006185|I've heard they're even letting Albs into their city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006184|They've started believing Abessa is a state.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006183|The Clerics in the Domed City haven't been true Clerics for some time now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006182|My team? No way. These Clerics are sworn to Calaan and the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006181|You think some of your team aren't loyal?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006180|Why won't the Clerics here help you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006179|Loyal to the Hort, unlike the other Clerics here in Abessa. I mean if the ones in the Domed City would lend a hand...end of problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006178|I am a Cleric Legate from Ignadon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006177|My name is Egon.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006175|What are you doing out here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006174|So, with that out of the way...what brings you here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006173|Well, it was always going to be long odds, but it was worth asking.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006172|No, no, obviously not. What is that guy playing at out there?|Realising the player's not been ' suggested'. Growing concerned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006171|Nothing? He didn't try to recruit you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006170|No. He didn't say anything about that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006169|You did? And, did he say anything to you about how his mission to find new recruits?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006168|Yes well, it was always going to be unlikely, but I had to ask.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006167|Good to know. Thank you for the information.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006166|Like you said already. He is looking for new recruits.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006165|Really? Do you know what he has been doing out there for so long?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006164|Thank you for the information. I'll inform his next of kin.|Military, strict
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006163|That explains why we didn't get those recruits...|Military, strict
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006162|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006161|Dead? You know that for sure?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006160|He is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006159|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006158|No, I haven't met him.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006156|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006154|But, we've gone through an entire cycle here and haven't heard from him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006153|He is out there searching for new recruits and was supposed to report here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006152|Really? Tell me, did you happen to come across a Suggestor called Rainer during your travels?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006150|So, try again. Which direction did you come from? Abessa or Ignadon?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006149|There is not other way you came here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006148|Ignadon is one way and Abessa is the other. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006147|Neither.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006146|From Ignadon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006145|From Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006144|You don't often meet other people here.|Military, strict
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006143|So, do you want to tell me who you are and where you came from? Abessa, or Ignadon?|Military, strict
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006142|Well, hello, I hope you're having a good day of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006141|The only thing that keeps me sane out here is growing things. It means there is always something to do.|Happy, sing songy
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006140|Be careful. Don't underestimate these Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006139|There still really are good people in the world. I had almost given up hope.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006138|I will take care of the Albs threatening you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006137|I know you don't owe me anything. But I would be thankful if you could drive the Albs from this place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006136|But, I can't take care of the Albs and protect him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006135|Thank you for everything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006134|I don't have a lot that I can give you. I hope that will be enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006133|Thank you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006131|I have respect for life even if they don't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006130|I will take care of their bodies and bring them to their final resting place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006129|Then they got nothing but the punishment due to them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006128|The Albs who took over your home are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006127|So be it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006126|If you want me to leave here then you will have to kill me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006124|Either you get out of here and give up the Elex deposit, or I will kill you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006123|They sent you? You're working for them? What do they want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006122|The Albs sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006121|But, now you are in our way now and our mission must be completed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006120|You were honorable and did not attack us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006119|I'm afraid that we cannot allow that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006118|You will leave Arva and her friend in peace.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006117|The Elex deposit, the woman and her troll are located there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006116|Climb down the mountainside. There you will find some Old World ruins.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006115|To the southeast.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006114|Where can I find this woman and her troll?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006113|You can expect generous payment if you bring us news that they are both dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006112|And I will mention this again just to give you a little more motivation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006111|We will await your success.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006110|Understood.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006109|Can you assist us? We would pay you if you were to kill the woman and her troll.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006108|I will take care of the troll and the woman for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006107|I will pay you generously to ensure that you will be motivated to help us again in the future.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006106|We will begin securing the Elex deposit now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006105|That is satisfactory.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006104|The troll and the woman are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006103|And we need that Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006102|However she does it, the two of them work together. That makes attaining the Elex we need more hazardous than our initial assessment had predicted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006101|We don't know how she controls it. She lacks the technical connection used by our own people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006100|She is there now with a troll.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006098|The problem is that she fled into the valley where an Elex deposit is. We want that Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006097|Possibly. Her escape, is not the problem though.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006096|A woman. She fled into the valley. Her name is Arva, according to the notes we found in the house.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006095|And are you going to try and kill her too?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006094|Someone survived?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006093|Emotion is why these people, all but one of these people, died.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006092|That is why we still take Elex. We will not allow emotion to cloud our judgement as these people did.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006091|The people here were blinded by emotion. They attacked us. We killed them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006090|But, if people act against us then we will take appropriate action.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006089|Are you asking about the dead in the house over there? That's simple. If we are left alone, we will not interfere with others.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006088|All we want is the Elex deposit here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006087|My name is Sardoz.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006086|Who are you? What do you want here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006085|What happened here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006084|This area has been secured, so turn around and make your way back the way you came.|Military, professional
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006083|So, state your intentions.|Military, professional
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006082|It is my business as long as you're here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006081|I'm just passing through.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006080|It's none of your business what I'm doing here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006079|Stop where you are and state your business. What are you doing out here?|Military, professional
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006078|This is the least I can give you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006077|So. He ate the plants. I hope he will get better soon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006076|Just a moment. I will give it to the little guy to eat.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006075|I don't know how I can thank you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006074|I have the Troll's Leaf you need.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006073|The Troll's Leaf will heal his wounds from the inside. At least, so the stories say.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006071|I need at least eight plants, I hope that that will be enough to heal his injuries.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006069|I will help you heal the troll. How much Troll's Leaf do you need?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006068|I would be thankful if you could look for that herb for me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006067|But, I don't dare to leave him here alone to go and look for it in case those Albs come back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006066|I can use need Troll's Leaf to heal his wounds. If I can find any.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006064|How do you even heal a troll?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006063|Why do you ask? Could you help him?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006062|Yes. The Albs tried to kill him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006061|You said he is injured?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006060|My friend is dead... Just, just leave me alone. I don't want anything to do with you people.|Distressed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006058|Well, 'little' is probably the wrong word. My friendly giant isn't exactly small.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006057|You mean the troll?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006056|What little one?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006055|What about him?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006052|About your big friend...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006050|I owe him everything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006049|There's just me and my big friend here now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006047|We were able to beat them back. But, I think, after they were chased away they must have taken their revenge on my friends.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006045|They attacked the little one there and injured him. When I saw that I ran to help as quickly as I could.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006042|Everything was good. We had made a new life until those Albs came...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006041|But, I think they are both dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006040|No. I was exiled with two others from Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006039|Those cursed Albs... They ruin everything wherever they go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006038|Are you talking about the house that the Separatists moved into?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006036|There are some small ruins there from the Old World. We lived there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006034|Do you see the three-pronged tower up there to the northwest?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006033|Where did you live?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006032|You aren't alone here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006031|What happened?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006030|But that was in another life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006029|I don't live here. My home is further up. I lived there with two of my closest friends.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006027|It is like when two lovers know what the other wants.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006026|The way we communicate far exceeds anything simple verbal communication could achieve.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006025|The Elex connects us together.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006024|No, not tamed. The little guy and I are friends.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006023|Why do you live out here on your own with a troll?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006022|You tamed a troll?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006020|It doesn't have to mean anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006019|Clothing is clothing.|Defensive, hiding her background
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006017|We are one soul. One spirit, together.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006016|Belong? No. He is mine and I am his.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006015|The troll running around here. He belongs to you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006014|If you aren't a member of any faction then why are you dressed like a Berserker?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006013|It's just us now. Me and my little one over there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006012|That is why we are so far out here. Away from factions, and rules and...rulers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006011|Laws, wars, stupidity, that's all you'll get from them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006010|If you are here to recruit me then you can forget it. I am not interested in joining any faction.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006009|If you are here to recruit me then you can forget it. I am not interested in joining any faction.|Hostile
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006008|I'm honoring my exile from Goliet. What else do you want of me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006007|What do you want?|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00006000|Travel safe, friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005999|I'll send a relief patrol to get rid of these reavers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005998|Thank you for bringing me this news.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005997|That can't be allowed to happen. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005996|The Reavers must have come to loot the Converter for Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005993|And so, even when we chase the Albs from our land their legacy continues to harm us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005992|Reavers have overrun a Berserker outpost close to the Converter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005991|I bet the Berserkers would want to know what happened here...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005990|This looks like it was a Berserker outpost before those Reavers took it over.|Considering the outpost after killing the reavers there.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005989|I must rectify my mistakes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005988|Calaan will watch over you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005987|You should commit to us. The training we offer would make you more powerful.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005986|But, you don't seem to have decided to join the Clerics yet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005985|I'm sorry, but I cannot allow that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005984|I chose you and you rejected us to join another faction.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005983|But, it seems I made a mistake selecting you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005982|Welcome to the Clerics. May you walk Calaan's path.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005981|I think you could do well here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005980|I hope you've realized the benefits of joining us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005979|Yes. I chose you as a recruit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005978|You're the one who brought me to the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005977|In Edan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005976|Report to Reinhold to begin your initiation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005975|Being selected as an Initiate is a high honor.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005968|You have to understand that you are being given a chance here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005967|You were given a choice and then persuaded to come here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005966|No. No, what do you think we are, Outlaws?|Superior
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005965|You have to understand you are being given a chance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005964|Not at all, you're here willingly.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005963|You're holding me prisoner?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005962|You assholes kidnapped me?!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005961|I want to become a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005960|Your place is here now. The Hort is your home.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005957|The Hort is a place of worship as well as a stronghold.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005956|Tell me about the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005950|Rainer, has selected you as an Initiate. A candidate suitable to be recruited into the Clerics. That is a great honor. Are you ready to undertake it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005949|You may be somewhat confused, but that will go away as the effects of suggestion fade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005948|That's it. Briefing over. You are free to move about Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005947|But, then you must know that all factions save secrets for those that join them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005946|Those who wish to join us must come to the Hort to train. The successful ones become Acolytes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005945|All who are clear of mind must hear Calaan's words. All must adhere to his wisdom. And, tell others of it. For we need to recruit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005944|All Initiates must be clear of mind. Chems are forbidden. Anyone found taking them will need to report to the Suggestors for reeducation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005943|You should know that anyone bringing Initiates into the Hort will be responsible for them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005942|You won't find the Calaan's Commandments too strict.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005941|Unless you've got any questions about the Hort I could answer for you then you can go in. Well, you can go in after you've had my briefing.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005935|We'll talk about this later.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005933|Well, I'm glad you're interested, but I can't really talk about this now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005932|What is this business you need taking care of?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005931|Okay, let me in and I'll talk to you later.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005930|I'm not interested in a deal. Just let me in.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005928|And, perhaps persuade me that you entering the Hort was for official business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005927|Accepting shards is forbidden, but, if you could take care of some business for me...That would honor Calaan.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005925|That sort of thing might work in Tavar, but here in Ignadon, it's an insult to my honor.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005924|I'm going to pretend you didn't try and offer me a bribe.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005923|Here, is this enough to persuade you to let me in?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005922|You can only enter the Hort if you are a Cleric, a recruit, or you have a trading permit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005920|Sorry, I thought I'd made that clear.|Not sorry at all

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005915|Welcome to the holy ground of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005914|You are awake. Good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005913|Where am I?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005912|The only people allowed in here are Clerics, recruits, or traders with permits.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005911|You are walking on the holy ground of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005910|Stop, Outlaw. Not another step.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005903|I'll take you there. At the Hort you can see what we can offer you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005902|Come with me to Ignadon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005901|Either way, you would make a valuable addition to our community.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005900|Either, you did answer my questions truthfully, or you resisted my powers of suggestion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005899|Then you are strong-willed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005898|No. I was truthful.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005897|No. I did not lie.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005896|Yes. I did lie.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005895|So, tell me. Did you lie to me when you answered any of the previous questions?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005894|I just have one last question, and please, don't lie to me. Honesty redeems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005893|Who hasn't done that in these times? It is good that you accept what you have done. With acceptance comes self-knowledge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005892|That is hard to believe.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005891|No? You have survived out here without killing anyone?|Doubtful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005890|Yes. I have.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005889|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005888|Have you taken the life of anyone amongst the Free People?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005887|And how have you survived out here? Have you given in to the bloodlust suffered by the Albs since you left Xacor?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005886|To know who we are, we must find where we belong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005885|The Berserkers have their own cause.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005884|A follower of the Duke?|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005877|Interesting...|Suspecting this is a lie.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005876|Now, there are Separatists, and...you. You aren't like the others. The Separatists still take Elex, clearly you don't.|Assessing the player character. Reflecting on the changed times.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005875|An Alb? We live in changing times. The only Albs to be seen outside Xacor were in raiding parties. Soldiers attacking the world they didn't know.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005855|For people who haven't heard the call of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005854|You see, we're here searching for lost souls.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005853|That's all right. We all have reasons to keep things to ourselves. That could mean you're precisely who we are looking for.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005851|I am just passing through.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005848|It is good to see an ally out here.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005846|Look. A disciple of Mana.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005845|Look. An adherent to anarchy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005844|Look. A brother of Calaan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005843|If you'd like, I can take you to the Hort our stronghold there you can learn more about us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005842|Joining the Clerics would offer you training, protection, technology.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005841|I know you want to set your own course, but you should think about what Calaan can offer you.|Persausive - in recruitment mode
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005840|I don't often meet people so strong willed out here in the wastelands.|Wanting to recruit him

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005836|Think well about how you respond. Search and find who you really are.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005834|Tell me about Calaan, your god.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005833|No thanks. Not interested.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005832|To help them find the true path.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005831|Calaan sent me to find lost souls. Like you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005830|What are you doing out here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005829|You shouldn't worry about who, or what I am. It is your path that matters.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005828|Who am I? I am nobody. Just a humble servant of Calaan, our creator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005827|Who are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005826|Do you understand the paths you have taken? Or, can I guide you to enlightenment?|Calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005825|Do you know what you are doing here?|Calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005822|Perhaps, my story will help you understand us better.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005821|Right, I have to get back to it. See you around, yeah?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005820|I didn't have anything to do with technology in Edan, now I feel like I missed out all that time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005819|But, you know, I really think I've found my place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005818|I wouldn't have thought I would like it so much.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005817|Hey! Thanks for getting me that job with the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005816|I still have to modify the AI systems so it is inefficient for me to talk right now. Have...a good day.|Struggling with the human phrase unused to pleasantries
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005815|And, so I began my work immediately.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005814|I didn't expect anything else once you had paid me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005813|The technician job is yours.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005812|An Outlaw always pays his debts.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005811|And so, before I do the work, you get the pay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005809|I got the job as Vivian's technician.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005808|Hey, thanks for the recommendation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005807|Whatever your motive. I guess we both come away empty-handed. Think about it next time, hey, that way we all benefit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005806|Or, was it some weird loyalty thing?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005805|What? Didn't you want to earn yourself some shards?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005804|Hey! I wanted Vivian's technician job. I thought we had a deal?|Put out
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005803|But fine. I trust your judgment. Let's cross him off the list.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005802|No? That's a shame, I was hoping he would be. It would have been useful to have a Berserker around.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005801|I don't think Rorik is right for the job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005800|Good, right, then I hope we have our technician.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005799|Meaning I will have to teach him some things. But, I can do that if he's the right person.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005798|Good, right, then I hope we have our technician.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005797|Loyalty is the most important thing. Out of all the Clerics here, I'm the one who can best understand a need to buck authority.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005796|Rorik will be trustworthy, but he does have something against authority.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005795|He knows his way around technology from the inside.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005794|You can't trust an Outlaw. Security has to come first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005793|Yes, I agree.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005792|I don't think you should trust Darrell, he is an Outlaw committed to Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005791|But, alright. Okay. We will try it. If he isn't good for anything I can always let him go..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005790|I was hoping for someone more experienced, I don't have much time to teach other people as well as keep things going here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005789|I think he will learn quickly, he is highly motivated.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005788|He doesn't know much about technology but he definitely wants the job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005787|I will take him on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005786|I hope you are right about him, so, well, fine. We will see.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005785|I want to believe you. I don't want to judge him by his faction, but I've been warned against hiring Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005784|Ah, that is good to know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005783|He knows his way around technology, and I'd say his loyalty is to technology, not his faction.|(Lie)
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005782|This should secure us going forward, At least I hope so!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005781|I had better go and take care of my new recruit right away.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005780|Here. Your payment, as promised.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005779|Thank you for helping me with the selection.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005778|Still, we are short of candidates, so I suppose we should try her and see.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005777|Hmm... I don't know if I want to take that risk...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005776|She is the best technical candidate, but she is also an Alb. I think she's worth trying, but you should keep an eye on her.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005773|Well...if she's convinced you then we should at least try her.|Accepting, but reluctant
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005772|She has the technical ability and I think she will work hard for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005771|Is that so?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005770|Okay. Then Nyra is out of consideration.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005769|You are right. Maybe she isn't right for it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005768|Thanks for reporting back to me on them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005767|She is the best candidate by far.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005766|Then you think he has the experience and that he will dedicate himself to the Domed City?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005765|Well, I said we might be able to trust an Outlaw, but tell me what was it that convinced you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005764|Then you think she will commit to us here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005759|That on top of the risk of letting an Alb into our technology, you're right, let's forget about her.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005758|Then I agree with you. I want someone dedicated to the task, not to shards.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005757|She wanted to be paid in advance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005756|Why not?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005755|You should give the Berserker Rorik the technician's job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005754|You should make the Outlaw Darrell your technician.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005753|Nyra doesn't want the job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005752|You should give the Separatist Nyra the job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005751|So, yes. I could imagine working with them in the existing circumstances.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005750|But, I understand that it isn't up to me to determine this|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005749|It think it would be better if this city was led by an Alb, or a machine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005748|Do you think you can work with the Clerics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005747|Even the Dome isn't running as efficiently as it could. That is another thing I could improve.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005746|I have already discovered errors in the AI systems of the Clerics' mechs and I would be able to modify them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005745|I served as the battlefield technician for my unit in Xacor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005744|What are your qualifications for this job?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005743|If I am to work for the Clerics then I would like to be paid. The Free People seem to value shards above all things and so an payment would be proof that they take me seriously.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005742|But, I need proof that the Clerics are really willing to work with me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005740|I will not work for the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005739|Good. Then you have made your decision and mine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005738|I'm not paying you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005737|Therefore, selecting me is the logical choice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005736|I am without question the best candidate they will find.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005735|Vivian sent me. About the technician job...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005734|Good. Then tell the Clerics I can begin work immediately.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005733|You will get your payment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005731|And the better access I have to new information, the better equipped I will be to ensure a war doesn't suddenly break out without anybody seeing it coming.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005730|And, as for my interests, you can count on me being a pacifist. I want to do anything to avoid a war.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005729|And, I can assure you that I am technically reliable.|Playing on the double meaning of technical
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005728|This job is about technical reliability.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005727|What's this job got to do with the job?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005726|What do you think about the Clerics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005725|And did I mention the whole, financially rewarding aspect of selecting me as the candidate?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005724|But, I'm a fast learner and If I have someone I can ask, then the rest won't be a problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005722|Absolutely crap. I don't know one end of a screwdriver from...well, a hammer to be honest.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005721|How good are you with technology?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005719|While, I'm certain there must be people better qualified than me, there isn't anybody who will pay you as much as I will.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005718|And I'm willing to pay any price to get it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005717|And, I'd like to apply for the job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005716|Yeah, good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005715|Vivian sent me, to talk to you about the technician's job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005714|Okay. And, remember to put in a good word for me with Vivian. I'll make it worth your while.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005713|I've heard enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005712|If I want to learn about technology, they'll let me. They're the same with everyone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005711|But, the Clerics don't ban some people from doing some things and not others.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005710|I don't know. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005709|I mean, just look at the Dome, that's an amazing feat of engineering!|Genuine interest
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005708|Strange really, my job used to be to get rid of technology, but now all I want to do is to put it back together. The Clerics make some incredible things.|Interest piqued
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005707|Well, back in Goliet I used to take machines apart. There aren't many I've not seen from the inside.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005706|I'm not a Berserker any more. I live here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005705|They don't bother me and I don't bother them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005704|I'm grateful they let me in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005703|If you get orders you don't like, will you run away from here like you did from Edan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005702|Okay. Right. I'll see you then.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005701|I have heard enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005700|What experience do you have with technology?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005699|So, now you've left Edan what do you think about the Clerics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005698|I've tried to learn since I came to Abessa. But, I'm still only just starting out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005697|I mean, I've not had much to do with technology.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005696|I'm interested, but I'm not sure that this is the job is for me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005695|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005692|Is it about the technician job for the Clerics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005691|Vivian sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005690|But, I don't know much about him, I don't even know where to find him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005689|If he's skilled and trustworthy then employing him might show that we do trust Outlaws here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005688|I'm hoping you can get that information.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005687|So, I want to know his motives and what his technical experience is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005686|Darrell is an Outlaw. He's applied to be a technician, but I don't know why.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005685|But, it will be important to find out if he is prepared to have anything to do with technology before we think of offering him the job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005684|Their magic is very powerful and they are strong warriors. We will need their help if the Albs attack us from Xacor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005683|And, it would show that we were reaching out to the Berserkers who have come to the Domed City.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005682|And, I think I could teach him everything else that he needs to know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005681|It might seem weird to consider a Berserker, but I was one once and I know Rorik used to work extracting Elex from machines in Goliet so he knows about technology.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005680|Rorik is a Berserker. I think I last saw him somewhere around Vito's pub.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005679|I don't know if we can trust her.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005678|Albs are usually very good with technology, but you're right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005677|We need someone and I don't think your faction always says who you are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005676|You want to employ a Separatist as a technician?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005675|Nyra is an Alb Separatist, so a bit of a long shot for loyalty, but she should have the technical ability we need. She's somewhere in the west of the city with the other Separatists in the slums.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005674|Hopefully some other candidates will come along.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005673|Well, at least I know now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005672|I guess I will have to put in more overtime myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005671|It's like we are cursed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005670|Well... It seems like we don't have any more candidates for the job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005669|Now, I suppose I'll never know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005668|Damn. I was putting my hopes in him. He might have been a Berserker, but I had the impression that he knew his way around technology.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005667|Then he is out as a candidate for the job. Sorry, that sounded cold, but I didn't know him personally.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005666|I guess I won't need to worry about her loyalty though.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005665|That's a loss, she probably had the most experience of all the candidates.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005664|Rorik isn't an option, he's dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005663|Darrell is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005662|Nyra is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005661|What do you know about Rorik?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005660|Tell me about Darrell.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005659|Tell me about Nyra.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005658|We'd be trusting them with the mechs and A.I. that defend the Domed City, so I don't want to employ anyone who might still be thinking about their faction, not our security.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005657|Oh, and I'll need you to let me know about their loyalties. You know, can they work with Clerics? Do they hate us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005656|But....speak to each of them and let me know whether you think they might have the right skills and abilities for the job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005655|The four names I have are Darrell, Nyra, Rorik and Riley.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005654|Great.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005653|Yes?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005652|About the candidates for technician...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005651|Yeah, I'll talk to your candidates.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005650|I'd pay you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005649|Would that be something you could do for me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005648|I have four people I've been told I should look at for taking the technician's job, but I don't have time to gauge their abilities.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005647|So, yeah, maybe I should look for someone else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005646|That's true. Alois has security concerns about taking anyone who's not been in the city long enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005645|Do you think they would employ me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005644|Maybe we could take you on in a permanent position here in the city?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005643|You do?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005642|We don't really have time to train people on the job. Not if they're not going to stay here for good and you don't look the type for that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005641|Ha, unfortunately that wouldn't be enough, I'm afraid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005640|On the other hand... If you are looking for some part-time work. I could still use your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005639|Oh, well that is a shame. I guess I'll have to keep asking around.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005638|I know enough to work on mechs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005637|I know the basics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005636|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005635|Say, are you good with technology?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005634|Which I'm having to do quite a lot of with all the technicians we are missing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005633|When I'm lucky, I get to roll up my sleeves and do some of the actual maintenance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005632|Which means I coordinate and plan their maintenance and upgrades.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005631|I take care of the mechs and drones here in the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005630|What are you doing here in Abessa?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005629|I don't have anything to say to your kind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005628|May logic guide you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005626|So. I think you have a better idea now of what drives us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005625|I need to find a way to explain this to the Free People. And, if possible, to find a way to free more Albs. It is the Hybrid that endangers us all, not our the Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005624|That is why I escaped from Xacor and searched for the Separatists. I wish to live in order, with my strength, but also with a connection to those emotions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005623|The Albs in Xacor aren't evil. Their logic, their intention is to save Magalan, but the approach they have taken since submitting to the Hybrid will be their downfall.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005622|I could see what we were being told to do was wrong. Despite the Elex I was given I could still feel those emotions below the surface, I could think.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005621|I survived the snow storm and those emotions and I was found by an Alb patrol, but by then something had changed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005620|But, the feelings I developed then guide me to this day. I overcame that moment and saw that there was more to life than simple...obedience.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005619|I will get to that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005618|Just about. With the fear, the anger, the grief. I thought about ending myself just to stop the feelings that were tearing my mind apart.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005617|But, you managed to hold on to yourself despite the emotions?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005616|Why did you become a Separatist?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005615|Water poured from my eyes. I felt like I was choking. I wanted to...scream. That moment was one of change.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005614|I began to feel...emotion. It was the most terrifying thing I had ever experienced.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005613|But, preserving my life used up the suit's supply of Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005612|If it wasn't for my armor I would've died within hours.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005611|And, I did well until I was separated from my unit in a snowstorm.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005610|They assessed me as best suited to train with the military.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005609|I was genetically selected.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005608|I was born an Alb. Born and raised in Xacor, a product of the birthing program.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005607|But, that shouldn't stop you thinking about the Separatists and our cause. We are part of this world just as much as Xacor and the Free People.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005606|I can understand that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005605|I am not interested in your personal story.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005604|Tell me your story.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005603|I will tell you my story, if you'd like me to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005602|The difference between us is that I have started taking Elex again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005601|I will be open, since your story may only be slightly different from my own.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005600|Does that mean you sympathize with our cause?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005599|You admit to knowing Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005594|So, there is no reason to communicate further.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005593|You have already said you feel an irrational dislike of my people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005592|But, there is no reason for me to explain things to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005591|Though the illogical and emotional behavior of people makes that far from easy. Their choices and decisions can be...bewildering.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005590|We have made our break from Xacor, so where else is there for us to go?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005589|If you have problems with the Free People then why are you here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005582|Then go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005579|We could use more people who speak for us. There Free People fear us. That is an obstacle to our survival.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005578|There are few non-Albs who can say that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005576|You do? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005574|Which makes me question how you did it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005573|Yes, you stopped taking Elex. That is rare.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005572|I can't stand your kind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005571|I know a lot of Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005570|I was an Alb myself once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005569|What does a forest-dweller want with me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005568|What does an anarchist want with me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005567|Do you usually spend time with people like us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005566|Although... There is something different about you...|Sensing something
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005565|You don't scare me. Your people are a plague upon this land.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005564|To drive me off, or maybe even have me killed?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005562|What do you want from me, Cleric?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005561|What do you want from me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005560|There is no way they will teach you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005559|It's nonsense to go to the Berserkers as an Outlaw and ask them about the secrets of their magic.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005558|You've already said you are allied to Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005557|They don't believe in technology, or in religion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005556|Especially not a Cleric. The Berserkers won't allow Clerics into their ranks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005555|The Berserkers won't teach magic to outsiders.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005554|You will have to decide who you want to join.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005553|But, I don't know if I can recommend that in good conscience. I left after all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005552|They won't teach their magic to outsiders.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005551|You would have to join the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005550|Well, it's pointless asking me. I didn't manage to learn anything useful before I was exiled.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005548|I would like to learn Berserker magic.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005547|I'd seen the Domed City when I was sent on patrol, so when I left Edan this was the place I thought of. And, here I am.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005546|And, I got myself caught. They sentenced me to exile in the Valley of the Damned, but I escaped.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005545|I stole Mana from the shrine to try and learn magic myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005544|And that was what got me banished.|With a sigh, Accepting his fate
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005543|Not that any of that stopped me.|Rueful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005542|My parents forbade me from trying. My clan told me to stop trying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005541|I always wanted to join the Hooded Crows and learn about the art of magic, but it wasn't to be..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005540|You know? I extracted Elex from old machines so it could be transmuted into Mana.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005539|Me? I was a worker at the Pit. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005538|Tell me about your life in Edan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005537|Not now, I've got...stuff, so...you know, later, yeah?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005535|Well, could you look out for him if you go, okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005534|No? Okay, well, thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005533|But, for now, I am just glad to know that he is doing well. Thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005532|Then maybe I should risk going back to Goliet so I can try to get him out of there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005531|That is good news.|Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005530|And, thanks anyways.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005529|First his brother and then him...a curse on all of Edan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005528|I had this feeling something bad would happen to him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005527|No. Shit...maybe if I'd stayed...You know I was even planning how I could get to Goliet to see if I could get him out of there. |Processing this, upset
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005526|Oh. Okay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005525|I haven't been to Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005524|No, I don't know Kral.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005523|I met Kral, he is doing well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005522|Kral is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005521|Do you happen to know him?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005520|He thought he still had a chance to save his brother Grimar from the Alb Converter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005518|His name is Kral. He's a guard at the Mana shrine, at least he was when I left.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005516|I can't. Not overtly anyway. I broke the Law you see? Like some of the other Berserkers here it was either run here, or go into exile for me. So...here I am.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005515|If you're that interested then why don't you go back and see him yourself?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005514|Who is your friend?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005513|A good friend of mine is still there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005512|Have you been to Edan recently? To the Berserkers' city of Goliet, to be exact?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005511|Oh, still...maybe you could help me anyway.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005510|I have been here for awhile.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005508|Anyway, I want to ask you something if that's all right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005507|I thought so. I saw you come through the gate, you see?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005506|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005505|Yes, I've just arrived.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005504|Hey. You're new here in the city, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005502|Well, I hope you find your place in the world. It's good when you do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005500|To protect what we have here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005499|That's another reason to maintain these Mechs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005498|At least that's the vision. Not always the way it happens.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005497|Like this place. I know it's not perfect, but Outlaws, Berserkers, Clerics, even Albs, are seen as people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005496|And it's easier being with Mechs. They don't judge anyone, they treat everyone the same|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005495|May your time here in the city be peaceful.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005494|Thank you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005493|I think I have heard enough. But, it was an interesting story.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005491|Building things, trusted, part of a team.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005490|So, I have been working on mechs and AI systems since then.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005489|The Clerics recognized that I was good with technology.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005488|All those hours taking scrap apart and putting it back together in Tavar really paid off there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005486|They convinced me to go to the Hort with them, not that I really needed that much convincing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005485|When I left the Fort I ran into a Cleric patrol.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005480|I think they wanted to take us back. I fled when they saw me. I didn't want to be taken back, or for them to kill me to hide their crime.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005479|Because, the reavers who'd taken me captive came to the Fort and wanted to speak to the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005478|And now you are a Cleric?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005477|Then, why didn't you remain with the Outlaws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005476|Life wasn't much different from Edan, but there wasn't the same raptor shit, the Laws, you could be who you were and no one judged you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005475|I learned how to fight, how to live off of scrap.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005474|I was lucky though. After several years, the reavers were attacked by some of the Duke's Outlaws. And, they took me back to Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005473|I don't want to talk about that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005472|It didn't take long for some reavers to take me captive... and then... |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005471|Wherever I needed to survive. That meant running from reavers and wild animals.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005470|See you around.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005469|So, go on, go and take care of your important business.|Put out
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005468|I don't have to tell you, you asked me about my life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005467|Give me a summary. I have things to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005466|Where did you go?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005465|I swore never to return. And, I haven't set foot in Edan again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005464|Why was I punished for whatever my parents did? Why wasn't I told what had happened?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005463|When I was old enough, I must have been around 19 years old then, finally I ran away from Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005462|When I was older, I also went out hunting, it was tough, but I was happy not to be in Goliet anymore.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005461|I helped out in the fields to earn food.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005460|My parent's house was taken, so I had to run errands to earn a place to sleep.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005459|It was hard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005458|I think what the Berserkers want to do, with Magalan is right, but I can never forgive them what they did to my parents.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005457|Nothing against the Berserkers, they're just people, it's the Laws I hate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005456|I hate the Berserkers Laws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005455|Nobody ever told me why they were exiled. I still don't know what they did, even today.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005454|Well, what else? They were exiled.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005453|Well, go on then. Go and take care of your important business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005452|You ask me and then you go leave and me standing here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005451|That...oh.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005450|I have no interest in listening to you talk about yourself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005449|What happened to you after your parents disappeared?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005448|What happened to your parents?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005447|I remember him, I remember my parents leaving and I remember me screaming. But, everything else is gone, it's just a blur.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005446|He took my parents and I was left on my own to survive in the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005445|But, when I was about 12 years old, one of the Warlords came to our home.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005444|As a child I had no interest in the Laws, of course.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005443|Back then, Bjarr ruled over Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005442|So... I grew up in Goliet in Edan. My father and mother were both born Berserkers and so that meant I was too.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005441|Okay, I'll try to keep it short.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005440|Just get on with it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005439|Right, I'll give you the full version, well, the short version of the full version.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005438|Tell me your story. How did you end up joining the Clerics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005437|If you are really interested in my tale then I will tell you, of course.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005436|That is a long story.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005432|How did you end up with the Clerics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005431|You grew up in Goliet? Why did you leave?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005430|You were an Outlaw before?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005429|What do you mean you've tried all of the factions?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005428|What do you mean? You mean you want to become an Alb?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005427|I have been a member of almost all of the factions, except the Albs and I hope I don't get captured and turned into one of those emotionless husks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005426|No standing in corners on Tuesdays, no technology on Thursdays, don't be rude to plants any day, I know the laws. You see I grew up in Goliet. In fact I've tried all the factions except the Albs.|Making rules up - joking
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005425|What do you know about the laws of the Berserkers?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005423|Ah. A Berserker. Strict on the Laws of Goliet are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005422|I know...'traitor', 'you left Tavar' and all that... but as it goes, I have tried all of the factions except the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005421|But, you should know that I don't feel like that. In fact... I used to be one of you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005420|But, then the Clerics don't set out to make you feel too welcome, do they?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005419|An Outlaw! I don't see too many of you up here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005418|The same with me. I haven't been with the Clerics for long.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005417|I haven't been here long.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005416|I thought I knew all of the Clerics in Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005415|Welcome, hey how come I haven't seen you here before?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005414|I think Albs would be perfect people if they weren't so emotionless, but then that is why they are the only faction I have never belonged to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005413|Even Albs are allowed in here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005412|No matter I suppose, All people are welcome in Abessa, as long as they are prepared to forget their past.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005411|There is something that is familiar about you, but I can't quite place it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005410|You first. Come on, who are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005409|Who are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005408|What is it you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005407|Nothing more can be done here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005406|If I want to get down there again, it will take a leap of faith.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005405|That won't do anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005404|Why should I do that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005401|And, to prove that, maybe I can help you to get into the city. If that's what you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005400|You backed the right side.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005398|And, here's a sweetener for getting the job done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005397|Then you deserve the profit from that. Check his corpse for the reward he offered you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005396|Gustav is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005395|Then draw your weapon and I'll see you on the other side, asshole.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005394|Okay. I'll do it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005393|Either way...Bring Gustav to us and we'll take care of him. He's the main thing we need to deal with.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005392|Maybe, maybe not, but it'll be one less Cleric.|Discounting this
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005391|It might even give us a way in, if he's not on the gate anymore.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005389|He won't come and fight us on his own, but if he thinks you're fighting as allies, maybe that will get him to come with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005388|Play to his ego, say you need his help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005387|Any ideas for how to get Gustav to come here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005386|No deal. I came here to kill you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005385|You have a deal. I'll bring him here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005384|Bring him here and you can have the shards he promised you, plus a sweetener on top from me for your help. How's that for profit?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005383|I want to see that asshole's eyes when he dies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005382|It seems you can get close to him, so I want you to persuade him to come out here. Say, you need help, or something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005381|He's not going to leave us alone until he's dead himself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005380|If Gustav has decided he wants us dead then he's too much of a danger.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005379|Ha, there's someone who understands profit. You'd make a good Outlaw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005378|You want shards? What the hell would a Berserker spend them on?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005377|A Cleric that understands profit...well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005376|Ha, spoken like a true Outlaw|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005375|What do I get for running your errand?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005374|If we leave, we're dead anyway. So, I guess that leaves us here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005373|I'm not telling him anything. Leave now, or die.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005370|I always said that piss streak was a coward.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005369|We're going nowhere. You tell him that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005368|His power ends at the gate to the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005367|If he wants that then he can come and tell us himself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005366|And he sent you to tell me that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005365|He wants all of you to leave, now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005364|He wants you all dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005363|I can't imagine he's opening the gate for us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005362|What does that tool want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005361|I've got a message for you from Gustav, the guard on the gate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005360|It was good doing business with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005359|I would like to remain informed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005358|And, if any more Outlaws take up residence there, or inside the city, let me know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005357|But, I'm only giving you half as I had to do half the work.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005356|No, no, good. Look, here's your reward. And, the Domed City's thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005355|Gone? Do you mean...? You've not brought me any heads have you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005354|The Outlaws have gone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005353|I will follow you. Lead the way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005352|But, I'll only pay half. I'm risking my life and my job coming to help you. Okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005351|Very well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005350|And, no heads, don't bring me any heads.|Flustered.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005349|And, don't trade with them. Or, you can forget your reward.|Flustered.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005348|No, no, I didn't...Just make sure that the Outlaws disappear.|Flustered.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005347|By Calaan, what? No, no. What am I supposed to do with their heads?|Flustered. Realising what he's said and back tracking
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005346|Okay. I'll bring you their heads.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005345|You want their heads?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005344|But, you need to prove you did it by....by...bringing me their heads!|Getting over excited
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005343|I will have your reward ready when you come back. Oh, it will be such a relief to know they're gone.|Straight then his emotion building
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005342|Well, if you're willing to try then I would be grateful if they'd vanish.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005341|Are you sure you can handle this?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005340|Just make sure they disappear. Every last one of them.|Determined
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005339|Can't you do it for your people? The ones we shelter? No...well, very will I will pay you.|Appealing, reluctant
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005338|The Outlaws are the worst. They don't understand rules, or sharing, or in some cases that people have a right to stay alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005337|I would've hoped a Cleric would do this from a sense of duty, but...if you will get rid of them, I will pay.|Slightly put out
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005336|Pay me and those Outlaws are gone.|plus one cold
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005335|Well, if you want to earn a profit I will make it worth your while.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005334|You will? Heh, I knew I was right to talk to an Outlaw.|Surprised, pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005332|You can't miss them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005331|They've gathered east of here at an old farm not far from the city walls. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005330|Where are these Outlaws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005329|So, be on your way. Abessa City can do without you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005328|I didn't think you'd have the stomach.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005327|I'm not killing Outlaws for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005326|If the price is right I will take care of the Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005325|You mean the threat on our doorstep? The canker in our midst? They who should disappear?|Getting wound up
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005324|About the Outlaws in the farm...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005321|I just want them to stop causing trouble for good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005320|Hey, ho. Hoo, hey. That's not what I said.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005319|You want the Outlaws in the farm to die?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005318|That makes keeping order difficult sometimes. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005317|Being away from home you think they'd care less about what faction they were from, but for some reason some of them have got even more fanatical.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005316|Outlaws. Berserker. Clerics... Anyone who wants to be somewhere other than their homeland.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005315|Well, the Domed City is a refuge for all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005314|What's happening in the city?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005313|They just want to get in to cause trouble. I mean we'd got everyone settled down and living together and those Outlaws...I just wish they'd disappear.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005312|There's a half dozen Outlaws hanging around outside the city at the old farm now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005311|But, that means all. Not just Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005310|All people are welcome here. The Domed City is a refuge for all.|Falling back on the official line
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005309|You don't seem to like Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005308|We're having...well talk to Gregor, I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005307|We aren't letting a lot of people in at the moment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005306|If he doesn't, well come back to me and I'll talk to him for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005305|And, as a servant of Calaan, I'm certain he will allow you in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005303|But, as an Outlaw I wouldn't bother. He won't let you in, so you might as well just leave.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005302|You'll have to go to Gregor at the other gate. He is the only one authorized to issue new IDs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005301|How do I get an ID?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005300|I'm ready. Shall we go to the farm?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005297|See Gregor at the other gate if you want to request entry into the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005296|Halt! You are not allowed in without an ID card.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005295|Yes. Let's go and take care of these Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005293|It can't go unguarded, after all. I'll be right back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005292|Just wait a moment. I have to find a replacement at the gate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005291|There are too many Outlaws at the farm. I need your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005290|Nobody is allowed into the city without an ID.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005289|Halt!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005288|That has to be their hiding place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005287|Once you are up there, you'll see the mine up there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005286|Anyway, you cross that then follow the track up and to the right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005285|First you go over the old root bridge. It used to be used to take wood up to the mine, to make the props and things.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005284|Where is this mine?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005283|I've already repaired the components. They just haven't all been installed yet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005282|Thanks for the offer, but that's not necessary.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005279|Now...we wait...|Inferring that something is likely to happen
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005278|Here, a little extra for a job well done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005277|Aaah. That is excellent. Good work.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005276|Yes, Lutz installed it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005275|But, shit, I wanted that way out of here.|Disappointed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005274|Well, that's something. |Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005273|Don't worry, I sorted things out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005272|And, was there any trouble? You didn't mention my name, right?|Worried
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005271|Well, he did.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005270|What? No way. That was premium work, there's no way Lutz is capable of spotting work as good as that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005269|No, he noticed the modification straight away.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005268|And? Did he install it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005267|I took the energy regulator to Lutz.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005266|I thank Calaan for sending you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005265|Good, the Dome should be more stable now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005264|Lutz has the energy regulator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005263|Thanks for bringing it. Erich will sort out payment for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005262|I will install it and hope that's the case.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005261|Modified it? Well, okay. Well, if that's the case. I suppose Erich knows what he is doing.|Dubious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005260|Erich modified the regulator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005259|Meanwhile, I will install this regulator and get things working again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005258|You go back to see Erich, he'll sort out payment for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005257|Thank you for bringing it to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005256|I'll install it immediately. You had better get back to Erich. You can tell him I'm putting it in right now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005254|Thanks for getting that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005253|Thanks for letting me know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005252|It's a good job you said, now I can fix it|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005251|Then there's bound to be something wrong with it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005250|You trusted this regulator to an Outlaw?!|Is he crazy?!
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005249|Well, I'd better get on. I'll see you around. Oh, an go and see Erich if you want paying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005248|It'll be Outlaws. But, why they would go so far as to endanger the shield is beyond me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005247|I wasn't there so I don't know who could have tampered with it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005246|You probably left that laying around near some Outlaws, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005245|But, the damage isn't so bad. I'll repair it and get it working properly.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005244|Yes.... someone's definitely tried to sabotage this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005243|Let's see...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005242|Well, if this has been left somewhere I'll have to check it out. People are always looking for opportunities to cause problems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005241|Other business, that's more important than keeping the Dome up?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005240|Okay. As you say. Erich will have had his reasons.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005239|Glad you've seen sense. Here, take this. You shouldn't leave empty-handed for the risk you took.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005238|Another Outlaw paid me to take a look at it. I don't know what he did with it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005237|Get out of here, go on and don't think I won't report this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005236|Oh, Calaan. We could have been overrun by Albs if I fitted this. I will have to repair this and get rid of any modifications before I fit it. Thanks for an extra job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005235|You really would do anything for a few shards, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005233|I knew it. You damn Outlaws sabotaged this regulator didn't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005231|Well, no offense, Outlaw, but I'm going to need to inspect this thing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005230|An Outlaw did something to it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005229|I couldn't come straight away, so I had to leave the part on one side until I finished some other business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005228|Yes, I brought it here straight from him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005227|This is definitely what Erich gave you? It doesn't look at all standard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005226|Perfect. That looks great, thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005225|Hmmm... That thing looks kind of... odd...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005223|Yes. Here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005222|Thank Calaan. Do you have the energy regulator?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005221|Erich sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005220|You'll need to go to Erich to fetch them for me. But, do me a favor and don't take forever in getting them here, all right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005219|You would? Well...okay, yeah. That would give me time to stop this from going pfooom!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005218|I can get the replacement parts for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005217|And I'm the one who has to fix all this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005215|Altogether that makes for one dangerous set of problems that could fry both of us if the wrong bit of kit gets jolted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005214|The energy regulators are screwed. The surge gauge is failing, and I can't see why, and now the shield profiler is returning a really strange set of values.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005213|Every machine you Outlaws touch falls apart after three minutes.|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005211|Keep your hands off my machines.|Warning
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005210|I hope we don't have to use it, but it's there just in case.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005209|If things escalate here. If the Clerics won't let us out of the city anymore, or the Outlaws lose it then we have a way out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005208|All that I did was install a small... Emergency shut off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005207|Nothing at first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005206|What happens if I this thing is installed now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005205|Now, I've got a way out of here, so you know who to find if things go to hell.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005204|You won't regret trusting me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005203|Take it to Lutz like Erich asked you to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005202|So. Done. Here you go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005201|Give me a moment. It won't take long.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005199|And don't come back to me and ask for help when no one will let you out of here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005198|Then you've blown your chance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005197|Now, hand over the regulator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005196|Alright, alright. Here, take this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005195|Pay up, or you don't get the regulator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005194|I am a Cleric. If you want me to act against my own people, you have to make it worth my while.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005193|500? Are you serious?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005192|Here. Now, give me the regulator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005191|I can agree to that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005190|Here. Give me the regulator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005189|I won't give you the regulator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005188|I want at least 200 shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005187|Okay. Give me the 100 shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005186|500 and we have a deal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005185|Okay. Here's the regulator.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005184|What do you think about 100 shards?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005183|I respect that attitude.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005182|A Cleric who is ready to take a bribe. Finally, one of you prepared to take a wider view.|Surprised
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005181|What's in it for me, if I help you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005180|Enjoy your days while you still can.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005179|You, you really don't have to worry about getting out of here. Just take your time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005178|Well, you might regret it when the time comes. You've lost the chance to make a friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005177|All I want to do is survive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005176|You didn't even ask me what I am planning.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005175|You've got to see why I'd want a way out, yeah? So, do we have a deal?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005174|Let me modify it. Then I'll give it back to you, so you can get it to where it needs to be.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005173|I want to modify the regulator so I can drop a section of the dome and get out if things go bad.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005172|So, I want a way out of here if things go wrong. A sort of back door.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005171|All the anger and plotting? It scares the hell out of me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005170|Haven't you noticed the tension here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005169|Why do you want the regulator?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005167|You Clerics all have sticks up your asses. You think your Calaan wouldn't understand me wanting to stay alive?!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005166|I'm a Cleric, I won't betray the Domed City.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005165|Very soon now, you're going to need the right sort of friend and giving that to me will mean earn you that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005164|Give it to me will you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005163|He gave you an energy regulator for the Dome, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005162|Hey you. I heard you speaking to Erich.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005158|Okay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005157|Let's trade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005156|I have nothing else to sell.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005155|I'll give you good prices for them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005154|So, if you find any, bring them to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005152|You don't have any broken energy weapons, chainswords, or anything like that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005151|I thought I knew all of the Outlaws here in the city. Are you new here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005150|You're not a Cleric I've seen before. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005149|You are new to the city, aren't you?|Friendly
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005148|Hey, you!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005147|Come back to me when you're done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005145|Please, take it to Lutz and help him to install it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005144|I have the energy regulator here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005143|Yes. I suppose I must remember the rules of this place. It doesn't matter who you were, it's who you are now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005142|Well, you help me and maybe I'll plant some trees later in your honor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005141|The cause outweighs the means, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005140|Alright, good. We have a deal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005139|Okay. I know profit pays for loyalty with Outlaws and I do need this done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005138|Anything for a profit?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005137|All right. This job needs doing and I do need help.|Reluctantly
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005136|I know none of us profit if the Albs get in here. I want to help you make the Dome safe.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005135|Is that so?|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005134|Good bye.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005133|Well, I don't trust you, now with this. So, you leave me alone and I'll leave you alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005132|Okay. I know profit pays for loyalty with Outlaws and I do need this done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005131|Anything for a profit?|Picking up on the outlaw phrase 'profit'
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005130|If I work for someone, they need to trust me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005129|You need this job done. Pay me and it will be.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005128|Get out of here you asshole. I'll deal with this myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005127|I wouldn't have expected anything different from an Outlaw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005126|You should go to Ignadon one day. You could be a good Cleric. Yes, I know, I've left Ignadon behind, but they could offer you better training than I could.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005125|So, let's find out who you are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005124|Do you want my help, or not?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005123|Do you want my help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005122|I thought you Berserkers didn't want anything to do with technology?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005121|But I wouldn't have expected anything else from a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005120|I'm helping you because I expect to get paid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005119|I am not like the other Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005118|Then go fuck yourself and watch your Dome collapse as you do.|Humane cold minus one
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005115|I don't trust the people of Tavar as far as I can spit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005114|And why would an Outlaw want to help us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005113|But, whether it's a discharge, or an emergency shutdown, both scenarios would see us defenseless.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005112|Otherwise the discharge it would create could kill a whole lot of the people the shield supposed to be protecting.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005111|If just one regulators fails, it could mean an emergency shutdown for the Dome.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005110|But, Lutz hasn't received his yet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005109|Well, all of them. I've sorted replacements where I can.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005108|How many energy regulators are broken?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005107|What will happen if they aren't repaired?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005106|I will help you with the energy regulators.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005105|About the broken energy regulators...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005102|Of course they are. Outside of frying yourself if you try and adjust them, if we were attacked right now the while Dome could go critical.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005101|I had wanted to do it myself, but...do you really think you could handle it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005099|I can repair the energy regulators for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005098|Malfunctioning energy regulators sound dangerous.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005095|Some of the energy regulators are starting to malfunction again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005092|As long as we can maintain a constant energy flow then they can't get in. Unfortunately, achieving that isn't so easy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005091|Of course. Why do you think we built it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005090|Can this Dome survive an Alb attack?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005089|I don't have anything more to say to you. Your conduct with regards to your own race is shameful.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005088|I've done my duty. Now a word from me. Fuck off back into the wilderness and die, Alb. We don't want your kind here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005087|We will go, but this betrayal ends our alliance. Do not look to us for help Ceric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005086|You and all Albs must leave the city immediately.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005085|Serious charges have been made against you and they have been judged to be true. Your permission to stay in the city has been revoked.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005084|Yes, Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005083|Fenk. Alb Separatist. You were given permission to enter the Domed City of Abessa?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005082|Well, none of us are allowed to return to Edan now, or we'd end up being sent to the Valley.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005080|We've kept our beliefs, but left behind the Laws. We set our own rules here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005079|What if Fenk actually did meet with the Albs from Xacor?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005078|Right, okay, but be careful when you speak with him. What if I was right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005077|I want to speak with Fenk about this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005076|Do that. The less I have to do with this the better.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005075|I should speak to Caleb before I give you any advice..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005073|About the threat of you being thrown out of the city...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005072|Then you convinced Jorg to speak up? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005071|The Albs were exiled from the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005070|Does that mean you're exiles?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005068|You are separate from the Berserkers in Edan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005065|There has to be a way to do that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005064|Or, make sure he stops denying what he said.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005063|So, I have to jog Jorg's memory.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005061|What information do you think they've shared?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005060|Who is this eyewitness?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005056|Can't you all just go back to Xacor? What do you have to keep coming here for!?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005055|Fuck, what is this? An invasion? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005054|That should serve you as reward enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005053|You proved that you listen to your soul. I respect that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005052|You have earned your place among us humans, Alb.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005051|Thank you for your service to the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005050|Here, take this. It's a small thanks for the big favor you've done us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005049|You did well. Allowing them in the city was simply too big a risk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005046|We have to push the Albs back to where they came from.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005045|Get out of here. I don't want anything to do with Alb sympathizers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005044|It'll be your damned fault if we all die here. Why don't you go fuck yourself? You've already fucked us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005041|I knew it. Never trust a fucking Alb.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005040|You! It was you wasn't it? You made sure Jorg testified.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005039|That is half of my daily ration. I hope it is enough to show thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005038|You service should be rewarded.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005037|It seems we can trust in the Clerics' justice after all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005036|That is good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005035|You managed to get Jorg to admit his lie to the Clerics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005034|You may remain in the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005033|You are no better than the Albs in Xacor who want us dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005032|I don't understand your motives for betraying us this way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005031|Jorg stuck to his lie and so we are being forced to leave the Domed City.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005030|Thank you, Caleb, I know you are right.|Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005029|Don't worry, I will speak with Alois and ensure these Separatists don't threaten what we have here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005028|And, I am glad that you stand behind me. You've always been loyal, Jorg.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005027|I am glad to hear you say that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005026|I mean even if, if it wasn't an Alb that Fenk spoke to, the risk of letting the Separatists stay in the city is simply too great.|Convincing himself
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005025|Yes, yes. That's true. I just wanted to say that I am behind you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005024|I sent someone to you for the security of the City. You know what you saw, you're just afraid of what it could mean.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005023|You sent someone to me because you seem to be afraid that I would admit my fears.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005022|What do you want, Jorg?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005021|I will speak to you after I have spoken to Fenk. I'll send for you Jorg, when I've thought about this further.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005020|But, this deceit can't go unpunished.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005019|You have been brave to admit your lie. And, you've done it before it had major consequences.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005018|I don't want the Separatists to be thrown out of the city because of me. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005017|I saw Fenk meet with another Separatist.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005016|I lied. You see...I didn't see Fenk and the other Separatists meet Albs from Xacor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005015|You did what?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005014|Caleb is not our leader. He just settles most things. But, there's also... I am here to admit that I lied for him.|Under pressure and then blurting out the truth
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005013|And, your reason for being here is...? And, why isn't Caleb here? There is a chain of command for a reason.|A little confused.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005012|Yes... Yes, that was me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005011|You want to do the right thing? Wait... Aren't you the one who saw the Separatists meeting with the Albs?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005010|I... I am here to do the right thing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005009|Jorg, what can I do for you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005008|I will go to Caleb and tell him that I won't say anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005007|Thank you. The Separatists must leave the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005006|You've helped me decide.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005005|I don't want someone to be thrown out of the city because of me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005004|You've helped me decide. Thank you. I will go to the Clerics and do the right thing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005003|It is time that I did what I think is right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005002|I have let people push me around long enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005001|I don't care what you think I should, or shouldn't do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00005000|You shouldn't do that. It's too risky to tell the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004998|I will stay silent for the security of the Domed City. This is our home now after all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004997|Yes...you are right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004996|The risk is too great.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004995|That... Well, yes, maybe, you are right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004994|You will keep silent. The risk of Fenk meeting an Alb spy is too great.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004993|No, I have had enough of his orders, I will go to the Clerics and do the right thing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004992|And, look what that brought me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004991|His decision has made me an exile from Goliet. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004990|Caleb can do what he wants.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004989|Think about Caleb. Remember what he will do to you if you talk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004988|Well, I wanted no part of this to start with. I'll stay silent. I'm not suicidal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004987|Well...If I were to say something, Caleb would kill me anyways. And, now you.|Resigned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004986|What? If you threaten me, how am I supposed to trust you?|Scared
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004985|Speak out and I will kill you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004984|Thank you for backing me up. I've been so worried about the truth.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004983|Well...then you are right the risk is too great.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004982|A former Alb. Like you, I can't go home without them thinking I am a traitor. I know Albs and Fenk is lying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004981|You are an Alb?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004980|I am an Alb. Trust me, I know when Albs are lying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004979|No, I don't really believe that it was an Alb. I mean, how often do you see them on their own?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004978|But, the chances of an Alb from Xacor coming so close to the Domed City is really low isn't it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004977|I am really not sure who I saw Fenk meeting. What if Fenk really was speaking to a friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004976|I wish I was as certain as you. But, I don't feel right about this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004975|Yes. I am sorry, but we can't risk it, not if Caleb could be right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004974|I will tell the Clerics immediately.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004973|It is so clear all of a sudden. How could I believe that the Separatists would betray the City? They need a home more than anyone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004972|Yes, you are right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004971|Fenk is not a spy. What I saw, was a Separatist.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004970|I... I... Yes... |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004969|You will tell them that Fenk is not a spy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004968|If that is your decision.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004967|You will go to the Clerics and admit you lied.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004966|No. No, it's too risky just to hope he's innocent. I can't say anything to the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004965|And, even if this Alb was a Separatist, we don't really know what they want either, do we?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004964|I will go to the Clerics and speak up for Fenk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004963|You are right. I have done Caleb's bidding without question for too long and where has it got me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004962|I will go to the Clerics and tell them that the Albs are innocent.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004961|You are right. I have done Caleb's bidding without question for too long and where has it got me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004960|We went against orders from Goliet. If I go back now they will just stick me in a cage, no questions asked.|Down
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004959|But, now, no, I can't go back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004958|I was always following someone or other and doing what they told me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004957|I let him push me around even when we were living in Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004956|You are right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004955|Whatever it was I saw, I saw it. Don't you think it's suspicious?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004954|How can you be sure?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004953|You shouldn't let Caleb intimidate you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004952|I know, I've always found Fenk...quite straightforward, which is rare amongst the people here. Maybe I'm judging him because everyone else here is so untrustworthy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004951|Because, I am free from Elex. You can trust me. Not all Albs follow the orders of the Ice Palace.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004950|You? You don't look like an Alb.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004949|I was an Alb from Xacor. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004948|I spoke with Fenk. He is not a spy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004947|What if Fenk actually is an Alb spy?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004946|And, for all I know, Caleb is right, that Alb could have been from Xacor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004945|I can't do that, Caleb will call me a traitor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004944|You should keep silent. It's too risky to guess.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004943|Go to the Clerics and tell them you made a mistake.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004942|Do you have any idea what I should do? I feel...this is a mess.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004941|About the situation with the Separatists...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004940|But...I have no real idea who he was. Or what faction he's with.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004939|He convinced me that the Alb Fenk met must have been from Xacor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004938|I didn't see any more than that, but Caleb decided to tell the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004937|It could have also been a Separatist, but I wasn't sure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004936|I told Caleb in confidence that I saw Fenk meet an Alb outside the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004935|My version? I'm stuck between the two of them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004934|Tell me your version of the story.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004933|I will keep silent. It doesn't matter now anyway. Fenk was... I'm not sure what to make of him to be honest, but...I am sorry he's dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004932|Then Caleb got what he wanted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004931|Really?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004930|Fenk is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004929|I will tell the Clerics that I didn't see what I told them. I speak on behalf of the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004928|Caleb is... was the reason why I told the Clerics what I thought I'd seen, but when I had doubts he threatened me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004927|Ah, damn, I'm just glad that everything took care of itself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004926|Really? That is...He was a good man. I...didn't agree with him in the end, but...|Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004925|Caleb is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004923|I shouldn't have said anything. Okay? But, what's done is done and that's that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004922|This whole thing between Caleb and Fenk is starting to get on my nerves.|Releasing pent up tension
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004921|Did he? Well, I don't have anything to say to those Albs.|Defensive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004920|Hopefully, it will be easier to get that confession now that Caleb isn't pressuring Jorg.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004919|But, if he were to confess, then people would see we had no reason to kill Caleb. And we may be permitted to stay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004918|Especially if Jorg stands by his lie.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004917|Then there is the danger that we will be suspected.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004916|Caleb is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004915|You had better leave now and stay away from us. Otherwise you will be expelled with us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004914|It is certain that we will be thrown out of the city now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004913|And people will think we killed him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004911|Then he can not confess his lie.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004910|Jorg is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004909|Everything is taking care of itself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004908|And his death will be a warning to anyone else who might consider betraying us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004907|Not any one who wants to keep this city secure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004906|Well, no one will miss that traitorous bastard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004905|Fenk is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004901|Well, it's sad but at least he won't be denying things anymore.|Quickly coming to terms
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004900|He's what?|Shocked
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004899|Jorg is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004897|What does he want now? I testified about what I saw just like he wanted me to.|Nervous
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004896|Fenk sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004895|Caleb sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004894|It can never be said again that the Albs might be innocent.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004893|Either help jog his memory a bit, or make sure he stays quiet. I don't care which.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004892|So, go to Jorg and make sure he doesn't talk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004891|Encourage him to believe that he saw what he saw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004890|So, how about you go to Jorg and present yourself as an Alb?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004888|It's for the good of the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004887|You can?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004885|I am telling you, this is just the beginning.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004884|No, never. You can't trust these Separatists. They'll betray us sooner, or later for sure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004883|You don't think that Jorg could've been wrong in the first place?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004882|I can make sure Jorg stops denying his story.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004880|And now he's started saying he isn't sure that he really saw Fenk meet an Alb from Xacor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004879|Sadly, Jorg is the only one who's seen Fenk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004878|Why would they meet if it wasn't to exchange information about the Dome?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004875|Enjoy your short stay here in Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004874|Well, you've just shortened the time you have here. We'll manage this without you and I'll make sure all your kind go back where you belong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004873|I don't know why I thought you'd help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004872|Once an Alb, always an Alb.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004871|And, I think the testimony of an Alb could really tip the scales and persuade the more reluctant people to change their mind and push the Albs out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004870|I want the Separatists out of the city. Simple as that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004869|I need help with the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004868|What do you want from me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004867|Tell me what you need done.|humane
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004866|I'm not helping you get rid of the Separatists.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004865|The Berserker Jorg saw Fenk meet with an Alb in front of the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004864|Traitorous bastards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004863|We have an eyewitness who claims to have seen the Separatists exchanging information with the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004862|Are you prepared to do that? Do you think you're even able?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004861|You could do us a service here. You could prove your humanity.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004860|But, hey, I have a way you can avoid the same fate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004859|It's easy to find ways to show you people have broken the rules of our agreement.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004857|I'll recruit anyone who'll help get this done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004856|Yeah. And you know what? I have already started to make it happen.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004855|You want to have all of the Separatists thrown out of the city?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004854|I don't care that people vote to let you in. If it was up to me, we would be better off if you lot were thrown out of the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004853|It is good that you changed your mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004851|But, if Jorg confesses his lie, then Caleb would no longer have the proof he claims. They would have no reason to expel us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004849|If people believe we are working with the enemy we will be exiled from the city and left to die.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004847|But, it is Jorg's statement that has put us in danger. That lie underpins Caleb's argument against us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004846|Caleb is already attempting further arguments to ensure our expulsion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004845|It is best if you go straight to Jorg.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004844|That is the response I wanted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004843|Good. That is the response I wanted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004842|I will help you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004841|We are no friends of the Albs in Xacor. They would see us dead. We want this to be our home now. We need the Free People to understand this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004840|They have already thrown one of our group out of the city. Now, they are threatening the rest of us with the same fate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004839|We are the ones with the most to lose if Xacor captures this city. But, the Free People are prisoners to emotion, it makes them doubt logic.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004838|He claims he saw us handing over information about the shield generators. It's completely illogical.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004837|Jorg is a Berserker, he's accused us of spying for the Albs in Xacor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004836|What is the problem with Caleb and Jorg?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004835|You will need our assistance. Until then, think upon my words.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004833|When it becomes known you will need people on your side.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004832|Helping me is in your own interest. You won't be able to hide your Alb past forever.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004831|I'm not interested in helping you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004830|If we're to stay, we need someone to get to Caleb and Jorg. They are key to our future.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004829|And the Albs in Xacor want us dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004828|We've persuaded people here that we are worth a chance, but there will always be those who won't see it that way. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004827|We need the protection offered by this place. We won't survive without it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004826|The Berserkers are already trying to get us thrown out of the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004825|Very well, let me tell you what we need.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004824|It is good that you offer to help us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004823|You have become fickle since you stop taking Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004822|First you reject us and then you offer help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004821|Do you need help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004820|The Domed City is our last hope.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004819|And, and whatever Caleb says is best.|Reluctant, he disagrees with Caleb, but won't say.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004818|But, when it became clear that the Seedling wouldn't grow, Caleb decided that we would remain here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004817|No, no, those days are gone. I left willingly to establish a World Heart here in Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004816|If you feel that way, why don't you go back to Goliet?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004815|Why can't people just all work together?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004814|Everything was simpler when I was a Cultivator in Goliet. We had laws and everyone obeyed them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004813|I am so sick of all of it. This belligerence between the Berserkers and Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004812|It's just...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004811|Sorry for being so irritated. But, I don't have anything to give out, I'm sorry.|Exasperated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004810|No, damn it! Who even told you that I have food to give out? I want this joke finished.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004809|Ah, but you're not here for that, are you?...Then I'm sorry, I...have been the butt of a joke that has left me rather angry and I thought...well, I'm sorry.|Slightly embarrassed.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004808|You're not? Ah, is that so...? Well, then I'm sorry, I...have been the butt of a joke that has left me rather angry and I thought...well, I'm sorry.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004807|The 'free rations'! The 'free rations', as if there would ever be free rations!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004806|I was promised food and I want it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004805|I am not here about the food rations.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004804|What are you talking about?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004803|So, you can just turn around and leave.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004802|Someone must have been making a joke. I don't have anything to sell, or give out.|Frustrated bluster
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004801|If you are here for the food rations, then I will tell you what I told the other hundred people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004800|They can't be trusted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004799|But, I don't believe a word of what they say. Who says they aren't spies sent here to deactivate the Dome?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004798|They might say we have the same goal, the same enemy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004797|They are coming here, to our city. The only city with a real chance of peace among the factions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004796|But, you really expect me to believe you Albs are going to choose us over other Albs?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004795|And you can tell me whatever you want about us having the same goals, or the same enemy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004794|You think they will if they know all their escapees are coming here. Edan, Ignadon, fuck it, even Tavar. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004793|We came here for peace, to escape the war. How long will the last if more Albs keep coming here? Xacor's left us alone recently.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004792|And, since they settled here, others have joined us. Some are escaped exiles, others just chose to leave Edan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004789|The Warlords in Goliet weren't happy, but they're stretched too thin for another conflict, so here we are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004788|But, they were cut off from Edan by the Albs. Left on their own to survive and, after a while, they decided to keep it that way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004787|As to why they came here. Well, the first settlers were sent to Abessa to plant a World Heart, to expand the forest of Edan out here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004784|I lead the Berserkers who've chosen to settle here in Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004783|Caleb.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004782|What do you have against the Separatists?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004781|And by that I don't just mean you, can you believe it, there are fucking Albs in the city?!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004780|Not to mention the damn Separatists here. They might say they're not Albs any more, but you can't trust them. Whatever they are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004779|Still, at least another Berserker will help balance things out between the Factions. You know they're even letting damned Separatists in here these days.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004778|Make sure you say I told you to leave. We've enough problems here, especially with these damned Separatists.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004777|Who are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004776|But before you go, you'd better tell me what you want here, Alb.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004775|None of you will be staying long.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004774|You can go and do whatever it is you Albs do together, but don't get used to it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004773|Well, you'll find more of your kind back there in the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004771|As much as the Clerics claim their they control the gates, they really don't seem to be able to stop some people getting in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004770|Well, on your head be it. You're the one facing exile if they find out you're here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004769|Then it sounds like you got in here illegally.|Annoyed, conversational
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004768|I was an Alb once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004767|That's none of your business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004766|End up with the city here like the Fort in Tavar? No thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004765|I wouldn't want to have to deal with the Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004764|But, I suppose you Clerics should be allowed some privileges as thanks for offering us all protection.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004763|This city is supposed to be sealed, no one is supposed to be allowed in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004762|I should have known Clerics wouldn't follow their own rules.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004761|I am a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004760|Who are you? Why were you allowed in?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004759|I saw how you came through into the Dome.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004758|You saw me what?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004757|I saw you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004754|But, tell me, what is it you want now you are here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004753|Most of the people have forgotten who they were, what they were, or just ran from having to decide in the first place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004752|So, what do you want from me, Alb?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004751|That Berserkers are even letting Albs into their ranks?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004750|How far have we fallen?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004749|I was an Alb once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004748|Well, then you'll fit in here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004747|I don't believe in Berserker Laws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004745|I didn't run away.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004744|Well then, tell me your tale of woe. Why did you run away from Goliet?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004743|Another Berserker we have to feed?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004741|We have to stop the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004733|That we are all here for a new start.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004732|I think people can see that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004731|We...we are trying to discover who we are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004730|The Berserkers... they don't seem to know what they're doing. Apart from avoiding their laws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004729|The Clerics say they are neutral, but they aren't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004728|The Outlaws claim they are being oppressed .|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004727|This city is a place of freedom, but all the old suspicions remain.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004726|That is exactly what we are 'tolerated'. We are still a long way from being accepted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004725|It seems like you are tolerated here in the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004724|It's the only way anyone will survive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004723|It's the only way we will survive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004722|We must bring people together.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004721|Even if your emotions are already starting to cloud your judgment you must see the logic.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004720|Among all these warring people, all these different agendas. We, you and I, share a similar destiny.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004719|I mean they don't even trust each other. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004718|They will doubt us until the day peace begins.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004717|Good. We have to stick together. People blame us for this war, even though we left Xacor to escape it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004716|Would you be willing to help us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004715|I will give you my support.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004714|You're one of us. An Alb out of Xacor with no way back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004713|You can deny it to yourself as long as you want. But, at some point, the truth will catch up with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004711|You betrayed all that you were. I don't want anything to do with you. |humane minus one cold
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004710|We've broken free from Xacor, from being slaves to Elex. And we've worked, persuaded people to allow us into this city and now we're here we are working to be allowed to stay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004709|What cause?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004708|Will you stay here and support our cause?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004707|But, if you're here...does that mean you're a Separatist now?|Realisation
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004706|I'm sure you would be very welcome.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004705|I heard they'd shot you down. That you were dead. Apparently, that was wrong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004704|Hey, you... Hey...it's you...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004703|So, here, take the ID.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004702|What's a curse for one person is a blessing for another, hey?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004701|That would get you in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004700|Maybe you'd want to take his entry ID?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004699|So, the timing has worked out well for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004698|You know, one of them had requested an entry ID for the city?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004697|Well, that's good news for someone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004696|The Outlaws who were trying to get into the city are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004695|But, I'll still give you an entry ID. Deal's a deal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004694|And, seeing as Cooper's got himself killed, I don't need to give you his ID.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004692|I appreciate you coming with the news. Just wish it was better.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004691|Well, the Clerics got what they wanted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004690|I knew he'd been gone too long.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004689|Cooper is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004688|Then I guess I'm alone again.|More disappointed than sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004687|Hunter is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004685|And, those Clerics call us Outlaws.|Cursing the Clerics
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004682|And a good job is rewarded, that's how we do things in Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004681|Then, it seems we can rely on you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004680|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004679|So, you came through for Cooper?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004678|He's had his mind totally scrambled.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004677|Shit then the Suggestors must've got to him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004676|I didn't do anything to him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004674|Just rambling about how 'happy' he is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004673|He's completely fucked up.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004672|Hey! What did you do to Cooper?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004671|I'm glad I am here now.|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004670|I'm glad I left the city.|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004669|Yes. I am happy. Happy that I've found this place.|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004668|I never want to return to the city.|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004667|I'm perfectly happy here.|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004666|Nothing. Everything is okay. I'm grateful to be here.|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004665|Nothing happened..|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004664|I am...I am nothing...Yes, I am nothing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004663|No. You aren't. You are nothing. You were never anything and you never will be anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004662|Forget...why? I am happy.|Fighting the suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004661|You were wrong to fight the Clerics, you will forget everything you know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004660|You're happy? Why are you happy?|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004659|What happened to you?|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004658|But, it's all right, I'm just grateful I got out of there.|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004657|I...I...Something bad happened in the city. I don't want to live there anymore.|Still under the influence of Suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004656|I am happy. I like living here. The Cleric's law will be obeyed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004655|I am happy. I like living here. The Cleric's law will be obeyed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004654|I must leave. I will be grateful. I will be happy to stay in my camp.|Hypnotised
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004653|You will go to your camp and be happy to stay there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004652|Be grateful you are being allowed to live|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004651|You will leave the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004650|You're lucky, you're getting a chance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004649|Fuck.|Shocked, scared
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004648|You know what this is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004647|Yes? What do you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004646|Cooper, Outlaw, you fled here from Tavar. Is that you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004645|Move along, civilian.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004644|Thoughts are who we truly are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004643|I'll check to see who this ID was customized for. Then a Suggestor can take care of the rest. Deceit like this, can only lead us to uncovering a greater lie.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004642|Please take your reward for honorable services to the Dome.|Overplaying the reward to compensate for being rude
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004641|Still that's not your problem. Thank you for bringing me the pass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004640|And I have enough to do to deal with that without...counterfeit passes, or toilet breaks for guards, or shortages of hinges in the west quarter....|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004639|If there is trouble with the generators, or the Dome then I am your man.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004638|But, Gregor keeps sending me every task he comes across. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004637|I've got enough to deal with without getting bogged down in the petty stuff.|Worked up
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004636|Shit, I'm sorry I bit your head off, it's just...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004635|Ah, no. It's all right, it's all right. Just give it here. I will take care of it.|Calming
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004634|I will take the ID to Alois.|Cold plus one
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004633|Tell me what to do again and you're dead.|Riled - humane minus two cold
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004632|Alois is the city's supervisor. You should report such matters to him! Go on, go and play Gregor's messenger boy.|Snapping
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004631|I told him a thousand times. I am not responsible for these things!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004629|Let me guess, Gregor, the Dome guard, sent you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004628|Are you trying to get me angry?|Angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004627|I have a forged ID for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004626|The Dome is a gift from Calaan. Never forget that!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004625|Besides, the cliffs around Hort give it a natural protection.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004624|That means there's no way to cover the Hort with a shield like this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004623|The technology is complex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004620|The Dome requires immense amounts of energy and the fluctuations in it have to be constantly balanced.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004617|Why don't the Clerics have a dome like this in Ignadon?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004612|Chief engineer here in the Dome, I'm in charge of all the generators and the technicians who oversee them|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004611|My name is Erich, by the way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004610|I designed the plans for it. Then we built it together.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004609|Everyone is welcome in the Domed City. Everyone is safe here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004608|To help the lost free themselves from chems, from Elex, from the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004607|So, here we stay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004606|Now, we stay to show that a Clerics' oath is strong. And so that we can demonstrate Calaan's grace to those who are yet to find it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004605|So, when the Great Council chose us to serve here as guardians, the Clerics did their duty. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004604|Calaan teaches that every pure spirit will find salvation in Calaan's arms someday. He will find us wherever we are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004603|What are you doing outside Ignadon?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004602|You built the Dome?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004601|Calaan gave us the knowledge, and now look at what we have achieved. A safe harbor for all people. The Clerics in Ignadon say we have strayed. I say we have found the true path.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004599|So, they pass us by. Like a river around a rock.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004598|They can't get into the Dome.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004597|We're cut off here under the Dome. Safe from the world outside.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004596|I just hope the Dome holds. There's a lot of people depending on this Dome of mine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004594|Heard, yes. But, we're cut off from it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004593|I'm interested.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004592|I'm sure that's just the calm before the storm.|Considering this
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004591|There is war going on. You must've heard about it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004590|Why do you ask?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004589|There are raids, but there have been no major assaults recently.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004588|I just want to know what things like outside the Dome. What's going on out there? Are the Albs attacking?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004587|You got here recently, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004576|Here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004575|Just give it here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004574|What? Now you've got it? What did you lose it before, or something?|Annoyed that he wasn't given it straight away.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004573|I have your ID card.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004572|Yes, I have something for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004571|Fucking Clerics. What am I supposed to do now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004570|Shit. He was supposed to get me an ID card.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004569|You've helped a good cause. Trust me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004567|I don't know if Hunter promised you a reward, but here's something from me in any case.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004566|I was starting to think I would never leave this stinking, Cleric infested Dome.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004565|Thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004564|No, he didn't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004562|You expect me to trust you just like that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004561|What's that got to do with you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004560|The Clerics can't be allowed to take Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004559|But, you must have realized by now, the Dome must go. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004558|But, I can't tell you our plan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004557|I trust you. You gave me my ticket here, after all. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004556|Did Hunter give you something for me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004555|Fuck it. At least the Suggestors haven't found me yet.|Disappointed that he's alone again.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004554|You mean he was afraid the same thing would happen to him that happened to me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004553|He was afraid he wouldn't be let out of the city again if he was caught.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004552|Why didn't he come himself?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004551|Hunter sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004550|Why don't you do something to stop the Clerics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004548|You think that's because the Albs are getting closer? Or, that those followers of Calaan really want a back door for invasion?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004547|Not allowing anyone in, or out of the city that's just the start of it.|Making his case
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004546|But, it's obvious they want to drop their neutrality and extend Ignadon's control into Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004545|I can see you talk sense.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004544|They say they are here to keep things safe, to keep order.|Reasoned, not paranoid
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004543|You think they bring security? That they protect us?|Reasoning this through.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004542|Right, good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004541|And are you going to give me an answer?|Straightforward
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004540|I'm for the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004539|I'm against the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004538|Do you back the Clerics here, or do you want them gone?|Straightforward
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004537|You get right to the point don't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004536|What do you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004535|Leave me alone will you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004534|Routine, my ass. I didn't do anything. Go ahead, feel free to search me. You won't find anything.|Disbelief
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004533|Take me to your damn Suggestors, or leave me alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004532|Screw you, screw your faction, screw all the factions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004531|You Clerics act like this city belongs to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004530|Ah, don't tell me nothing. I don't believe that. Not for a second.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004529|This is a routine check.|Businesslike
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004528|Absolutely nothing.|Disbelief
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004527|You couldn't pin anything on me, no matter how many times you try. Fucking Clerics.|Angry, hostile
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004526|I didn't do anything. What do you want with me this time?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004525|Hah, if you hadn't said I wouldn't have known, the picture looks really like you, you could be twins. All right, just this once, I'll let you through. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004524|You know that's not how ID's work. They're for the person they were issued to? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004523|Here you go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004522|Good, that will sort everything out in one go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004521|Okay, I'll buy an entry ID from you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004520|And, in return I let you buy a valid ID from me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004519|Well, I'll tell you what. How about I just say you brought this in to return it to its rightful owner?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004518|Or, is someone going to turn up here looking for a stolen one?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004517|Just lying around?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004513|You found an ID?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004512|And, that's not a request.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004511|Just make sure you take this fake straight to Erich when you get inside, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004509|Seeing as you played it straight with me you get lucky. I'll issue you with a valid ID.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004508|Well, I'll have to confiscate this, but what to do with you now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004507|I normally spot those right off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004506|A fake? Then it's a good one.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004505|It belongs to my brother. He loaned it to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004504|I found it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004503|It's a counterfeit. It's a fake ID.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004502|So, tell me where you got this one.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004501|But, everything seems to be in order.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004500|Well, this isn't regular.|Examining the ID
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004499|And, you were here asking about getting ID before.|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004498|Really? I thought I knew all the ones that had been issued.|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004496|You've done me a service, so I'll give you a valid ID. Just make sure you take this fake straight to Erich when you get inside, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004495|Thank you, we need citizens like you around here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004494|Well, that's good quality work too. I'm not sure I would have spotted that as a fake.|Examining the ID
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004493|What? Have you got one? Show me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004492|And, that's it. You may pass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004491|So, keep the peace while you're in there. Our Suggestors are busy enough without you adding to their workload.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004490|That means....Everyone is welcome here. Until they cause trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004489|And the Great Council gave the Clerics the responsibility for guaranteeing the city's independence.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004488|That's what was laid down by the Great Council of Magalan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004487|We can only keep peace in the city if we all work together. And we keep the city secure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004486|And, Erich will take care of them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004485|That sort of security is why we need to keep an eye on IDs, so if you meet someone who is in the city illegally report them to us immediately.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004483|Anyone you meet in the city who hasn't got proper documents, report them to him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004482|That sort of security is why we need to keep a rein on fake IDs, so take that fake straight to Erich, okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004481|First, stay away from the generators. Nobody but the technicians is allowed access to them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004480|Oh, and there are some rules I need to tell you before you enter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004479|Keep your pockets closed and your eyes open. Unless you want to end up shardless and dead at the hands of those damn Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004478|We don't want anything here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004477|I have an entry ID. Let me through.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004476|You know counterfeit IDs are being sold right in front of your gate?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004475|And do it as soon as you get in there, he's been at risk too long as it is. We don't need him being held, or worse, turned into a vegetable by the Suggestors.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004474|Take it to him, but make sure the Clerics don't see it, see him, or see you handing this over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004473|And, this is the ID for Cooper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004472|Okay. Wait a second. Your image has to be added there first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004471|Give me the counterfeit ID.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004470|You good with that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004468|Like I say, I can get you in, but I also need you to help me out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004467|That way he can come back out again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004466|But, once you're inside there, I need you to go and take an ID card to Cooper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004465|And I can give you a counterfeit ID that will get you in. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004464|He's an acquaintance of mine. He lost his ID and got stuck in there when they sealed the gates.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004463|Anyway, we're off the point, you want in, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004462|They're stopping them meeting up with us, that's what I heard. Paranoid assholes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004461|Anyone who tries to get around with ID is given straight to the Suggestors to be taken care of.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004460|We've worked hard to keep things running here. We can't start letting people flood in, or the troublemakers will take over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004459|And, that we can hold people accountable.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004458|It's important we keep the right balance here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004455|Of course, you need a valid ID to enter, or to leave.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004454|I heard you hold people prisoner if they can't prove their identities.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004452|Who is Cooper?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004451|Why would the Clerics stop people leaving the city?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004450|Not in, not out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004449|The Clerics have shut the city up tight. They won't let anyone who doesn't have a valid ID through the gate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004448|All right, all right, I just hope things don't go the same way they did with Cooper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004447|Just get me in there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004446|Why won't I be able to get out?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004441|Okay, I can offer you a way to get into the city. But, it's risky because you might not get out again. Least, not if they confiscate your ID.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004440|I wouldn't be here otherwise.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004439|And, you got turned away, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004438|Yes, I went to the gate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004437|If he refuses to let you in then come back and speak to me. I might know how you can get by the gate guard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004436|Well, seeing as you're not an Outlaw, it's worth you giving it a try.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004435|That asshole Gregor, the gate guard, doesn't trust us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004434|Yeah, well as an Outlaw, this might be as close as you get.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004433|No, not yet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004432|Have you tried to get in yet?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004431|Those Clerics are supposed to uphold the law, yet here we are. The gates closed to us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004430|As the law says we can. As the law says we should be.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004429|I want to get into the city. Can you get me in?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004426|We want to be in there. In the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004425|What do you want here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004424|Piss off and polish your laser somewhere else, Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004423|Spitball of a day, ain't it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004422|Where the poor souls barred from the city, stand and wait for the Albs to kill them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004421|So, go back and bow down to Calaan in your part. We don't want you here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004420|That means we are all supposed get part of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004419|That is a shared city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004418|You control enough of the Domed City without dragging your asses out here as well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004417|Stop right there, Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004416|Welcome to the Camp of the Impure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004415|It's a powder keg in there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004414|Carry on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004413|You'd better stick with the rest of your crowd. Then I'll know where to find you when we need to kick you out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004412|What, you're serious? As if we didn't have enough trouble.|Realising it's not  a joke.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004411|Bullshit, since when do Separatists travel in small groups?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004410|You? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004409|Like Calaan would ever welcome an Alb to the Infinite Skies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004408|Nice one.|Assuming it's a joke
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004407|A Cleric who used to be an Alb?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004406|You?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004405|The last thing we need is Xacor thinking we're harboring rebels.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004404|They still hit Elex. It's only a matter of time before they turn back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004403|Once an Alb, always an Alb.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004402|Too many.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004401|How many Separatists are there in the city?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004400|I was also an Alb once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004399|But, hey we're supposed to be a sanctuary, so someone decided to open the gates let the Separatists in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004398|There was something building even before we let those Alb Separatists in here. They just lit the touch paper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004397|Nothing right now, but it's simmering, you can feel it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004396|What's happening in the city?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004395|Say, there's a bunch of others who can't get in who have taken up residence in some houses near here. Why don't you join up with them?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004394|You'll have to wait till all this is over and done with. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004391|But, until law and order is re-established we can't risk any more undesirables joining up with them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004390|I'm not saying you're working with them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004389|Those Outlaws have us stretched enough as it is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004388|Enough from me, you'd better go in. And, report in to Alois when you do. There's more than enough work going round for Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004387|But, we're brewing our own mini-version of it in here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004386|This city is supposed to be a refuge from the war.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004385|There are Alb war bands passing by through here regularly and the Outlaws are planning some sort of rebellion.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004384|And, you might need to get out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004383|Here, this entry ID will allow you in and out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004382|Watch yourself, the Outlaws will be keeping track of you as soon as you get inside.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004380|The full allocation of entry IDs has been given out and we have instructions not to let anyone else in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004379|We need every man we can get.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004378|A brother in Calaan is always welcome to the Domed City.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004377|I am a Cleric. I can help if you let me through.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004376|You can't. We're full, we're short of supplies, so the decision has come down to close the gates.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004375|Where can I get an entry ID?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004374|No one is allowed into the city without an entry permit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004373|Halt. Not a step further.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004371|Error... No routine found...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004370|Routine running without error...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004369|I see.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004367|But, you'll get your Elexit, it might just take a while.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004366|You'll have to wait. Hey, it's not like I am paid regularly.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004365|When do I get my next payment?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004363|If it's here, tell it its going to stay here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004362|Right, now we can get this working the way we need it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004361|I have the drone prototype from the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004358|And, if you don't get it, I'll just ask someone else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004357|They're just a bunch of crazy, religious fanatics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004356|How come you won't steal from the Clerics? I mean... It's the Clerics!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004355|Wow, you Clerics really are different from the Outlaws, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004354|Just because they're your own people?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004353|What? You want to give up now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004352|Right, good. Are you sure this time? I mean I'm just hoping you don't go and change your mind again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004351|Okay, I'll get the prototype.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004350|Okay, well, you win some , you lose some.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004349|I mean if the Clerics found we stolen their prototype they'd probably go crazy...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004348|You're probably right. The idea was crazy anyway.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004347|No. I'm not getting you the prototype.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004346|I won't steal the prototype.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004345|The AI module on this drone is damaged, but it could come in useful.|Observing/examining
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004344|Laying around and letting a robot do my work sounds pretty good, actually.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004342|And, I don't need that sort of trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004341|Thank you, with these as a start. Maybe one day I will see Ignadon again.. .|Softening, seeing a possible escape
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004340|Give me that thing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004339|Alright. I got it. You are the boss and I'm the prisoner.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004338|Ah, well, if you're going to be like that, just give it to me before you break something. These things don't take rough handling.|Unable to help himself
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004337|Yes, I can do that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004336|You can do that?|Surprised
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004335|Then, I'd rather do it myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004334|Do it for free, or I'll put you out of your misery right here, right now.|Cold 1
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004333|Here, take your shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004332|Have fun with it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004331|There, one functioning AI module.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004330|But, you will have to pay me. Maybe, then one day I can buy my freedom...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004329|If it will help a brother of Calaan, I will do it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004328|That? Hah, yes, I can do that.|Not seeing any challenge in the task
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004327|I need this AI module repaired. Can you do that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004326|So, tell me what do you really want from me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004325|But, what do I actually get to do? Nothing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004324|They did say they wanted me to develop technology for them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004323|I think it must be because they enjoy torturing me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004322|Whereas you will have to tell me what you're doing here. What do you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004321|Calaan will have his reasons for bringing me here. Calaan sees all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004320|First you take me prisoner then you hold me captive and then you let me sit here going stale. You're wasting my talents.|Defiant

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004315|Outlaws, Berserker, Albs. You're all the same. |Dismissive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004314|I'm not an Outlaw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004313|I hate you Outlaws to death.|Defiant
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004311|What do you want from me?|Defiant
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004310|My only hope is that the Outlaws will let me go at some point.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004309|But, knowing the junk technology here, this thing will probably just blow up on its own even if I don't try and leave the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004308|An explosive implant will kill me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004307|If I go further than a few hundred meters from the Fort, boom!|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004305|You must know that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004304|Because, those bastards wired me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004303|If you don't want to be here, why don't you just escape?|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004300|It is good to hear them.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004297|What? Why would a Cleric be here willingly? |Taken aback
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004296|Yes, I was taken prisoner.|It's a lie. It even says "<text> (Lie)" on screen.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004295|I am here working for Calaan.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004198|You see a normal fighting drone won't be good enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004196|Of course. Let's do this thing!|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004193|You want me to steal this prototype?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004192|It's got enhanced intelligence, or something. That would be perfect for what we need it to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004191|You know, one of our Cleric prisoners told me they are making a U5 prototype over there in the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004190|We can get a new one from the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004189|If only we knew where to find one that was intact and hadn't been destroyed.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004185|I will repair the AI module.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004183|Then we're going to have to find another way to repair the AI module. We'll have to do it ourselves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004182|Shit...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004181|Elmar is dead.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004174|Okay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004173|If you have to pay him, I'll have to owe you, ok? Honestly, you'll get it back when I'm not broke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004172|Tell him I'll have to owe him a favor, I'm out of shards.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004166|Well, all right then. Good luck, let's see if this works.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004165|You can do that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004164|I'll take the module to Elmar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004163|I can fix it.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004157|That drone attacked me, I had to fight it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004156|What do you mean? Did you damage it?|Concerned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004155|Maybe, you'll have to check it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004154|It is functional, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004153|I have the AI module.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004152|See if it has an intact AI module.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004151|Here, I'll give you the coordinates.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004150|Looks like it's intact, but it's broken down.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004148|There's a drone not far from here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004147|Yeah! |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004146|I'll get you an AI module.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004145|You get that module and I'll give you 10% of what I earn off the gate. How does that sound?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004142|Yeah, this is going to work! We can do this.|Enthused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004140|But, first we'd need an AI module from a drone so Elmar can reprogram it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004139|Well, there's Elmar. One of the Cleric prisoners. He's a genius at this stuff.|Thinking
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004137|You can see where that could go wrong...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004136|Nah, it would be useless without the software. I mean an armed robot with the wrong sort of software.|Writing it off.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004135|And...replace the one in there already, that would give us a working sentry robot! Only....|Thinking about it. Enthused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004134|If we can get an AI module, I can reprogram it for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004131|No, I guess we would need help. Do you know anybody who could help us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004130|I can help you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004128|Any idea how we want to do that? I mean, of course, only if you want to help me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004126|I mean the Clerics use robots for things like this all the time...not that I know anything about Clerics, but.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004125|Let me think about it... |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004124|Yeah, yeah . ..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004123|It was just a thought.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004122|You could definitely replace yourself with a robot.|Wry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004120|But, noooo. I can't just let myself be replaced by a robot... Can I?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004118|Are you serious?|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004117|Pay me and I'll find you a robot.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004113|And, there's the trading district, I don't know who's managing that these days.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004112|Then if you're looking for Elexit, there's the scrap district, but that's controlled by Mad Bob and you're better off staying out of his way.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004109|Everything you could ever want.|Genuine
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004108|What is there, here in the Fort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004107|That'd be great, it would give me more time off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004105|My job, well...you could do it with a robot and a ticket machine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004104|Staying alive, my friend, I'm staying alive.|Relaxed

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004102|Pay him, or get out of his way. It's your decision.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004101|I think he scares them, even William won't try anything with him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004100|That ass was one of Baxter's men, I don't know why the Duke still tolerates him.|Shake of the head
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004098|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004097|What sort of trouble? Was he trying to get shards out of you?|Used to hearing this
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004096|You do? Well, step right in then.|Welcoming
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004095|That'll get him annoyed that I let you in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004093|Right, yeah. Big place for sightseeing this, we get tourists all the time.|Amused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00004092|Ha. Okay, okay, It sounds like you'll fit in here.|With a laugh

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003949|He wouldn't take charity, so I've been swapping old chems for meat, I mean no one else would take them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003948|He's been fading fast though, trying to survive on that trash heap below the Fort. I've been trying to keep him alive. |

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003939|Because, it sounds like you and Scrappy need some help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003937|Okay. I'll give you the delivery for Scrappy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003936|Ha. You are direct, I'll give you that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003935|Because, you'll pay me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003934|And, why exactly would you do that?|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003933|I've known Scrappy for years. He's the only man my old dad would listen to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003932|I could take the meat to Scrappy for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003931|Who is Scrappy?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003930|Here. Take this for letting me know. For you Scrappy, you were one of the best.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003929|He wouldn't take charity, so I've been swapping old chems for meat, I mean no one else would take them.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003928|He's been fading fast though, dying on that trash heap.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003927|He was the only man my old dad would listen to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003926|I've known Scrappy for years.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003925|Aw, shit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003924|Scrappy is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003923|And, as long as I've not already promised it to Scrappy, it's yours.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003922|What do you need?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003921|What do you have to trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003920|Tell me what you need and I'll see if I have it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003919|Sure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003918|Can we trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003917|And, I need to earn a living.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003916|No, this is something I need to do myself. For my family.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003915|Do you want help hunting these jackals?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003914|You're best out here with the jackals. Than in there with the real animals.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003913|In the Fort...hah, you think you know where the knife is, but the next minute you feel it sticking in your back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003912|You know where to find the teeth on a jackal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003911|Not that anyone there is really free.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003910|People don't work for the Duke that's the whole point of being Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003909|So, you work for the Duke?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003908|And, that takes most of my time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003907|When I'm not trying to get enough meat to live, to sell.|Annoyed that life interrupts his quest
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003906|I spend every spare minute tracking them down.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003905|Only that dipshit bred jackals. Thought he could tame them, train them. Now, I'm trying to undo the damage he did.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003904|Now, you're asking why I became a hunter...you could say I followed in my old dad's footsteps.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003903|Why wouldn't I? They ate my whole damn family. Now, I'm going to kill all of theirs.|Bitter
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003902|Why are these so many jackals in this area?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003901|You want them all dead?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003900|I think they know I want every last one of the things dead.|Gruff
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003899|Keep your eyes open. There're always more damned jackals.|Warning, wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003898|I don't feel bad about that..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003897|And, I've helped, you know, drugs are bad, so I took them out of circulation. Until now. Now I need the shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003896|So, sometimes you have to find other ways to get by.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003895|Ah, well, sometimes you find treasure amongst the garbage, sometimes you don't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003894|The theft of Doc's chems. That's landed Doc in trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003893|Where's the harm in it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003892|It's full of thieves. Everyone is stealing from everyone else!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003890|Of course I steal from the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003889|If I were to do s-something every time then I wouldn't have any more customers anymore!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003888|They steal and they rob.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003887|I am always being robbed. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003886|As much as you want. Whenever you want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003885|What's important now is that you can buy something from me and so can anyone else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003884|But, it isn't important... no, not important.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003883|You already told me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003882|Don't you want to know who had your chems?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003880|If you'd like, I can sell you something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003879|Not that I've needed to, I mean that was a high to last a lifetime. Literally!|With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003878|Or, taken it pure. Or, on my birthday.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003877|I've not messed with concentrated chems since.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003876|Let's just say, there was a mix up of the doses.|With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003875|When the Outlaws wanted me to experiment with chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003874|Then I had a sort of accident.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003873|But, I understand your confusion. Once upon a time, the old Doc was normal|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003872|I'm telling the truth. Cross my heart.|With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003871|I've heard enough.|Realising
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003870|Why are you laughing then?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003869|Only an idiot would believe that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003868|The Doc is a chemsmith, an artist, a businessman. I'm not a consumer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003867|Oh, I don't do chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003866|You've sampled too many of your own chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003865|You'd better be careful, secrets get out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003864|You'll keep this our secret? Yeah?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003863|They're my lucky break.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003861|Good, I wouldn't have given them to you anyway.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003860|I'm not scared of a fight. I've nothing to lose.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003859|I'm not just handing them over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003858|I give these up I might starve.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003857|That'll keep me alive some time longer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003856|Here you go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003855|Well, so be it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003854|There, take it. I'll be more cautious from now on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003853|I shouldn't have taken the whole package.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003852|All right, all right. Maybe you're right.|Guilt
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003851|You think?|Reasonable challenge
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003850|But, the Doc can make new chems any time he wants, can't he?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003849|Yes, I took a lot this time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003847|How is trying to survive bad?!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003846|Thanks for the warning. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003845|Yeah, you're right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003844|Give the chems back and steal less next time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003843|You shouldn't take risks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003842|Cindy might have done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003841|Did someone see you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003840|You stole too much at once. Doc noticed. Give it back and steal less next time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003839|What do you mean?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003838|I don't care about the chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003837|Give me the chems, or I start breaking limbs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003836|I'll pay you for the chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003835|Because, you aren't a bad person.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003834|You shouldn't steal so openly.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003833|I think it still works.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003832|I found it in the scrap.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003831|Say...how about you take this?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003830|That is really friendly of you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003829|Hope it makes you feel real tough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003828|Take them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003827|I mean what can an old man do about it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003826|Sure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003825|Tavar is a tough place.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003824|He was a crazy guy, but...|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003823|I'm sorry about that. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003822|But, I'm keeping the chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003821|Here, you can have those stolen chems back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003820|My shop is open again.|With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003819|Until everything was in stock, again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003818|The Doc has brewed and he has cooked. Brewed and cooked, I say.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003817|Come closer. Step closer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003816|Come back in a few days. The old Doc might have something else to sell then.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003815|Breeeewwwiing and cooking. Until everything is like it was earlier.|Spaced
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003814|Brewing, cooking, brewing, cooking, brewing, cooking.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003813|Shit. Then the old Doc just has to do what he does best.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003812|I can't find any leads on who stole them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003811|You can forget your stolen chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003810|Doc is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003809|Okay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003808|No one else is going to keep me alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003807|So, that means I need to keep stealing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003806|But, I don't intend on starving.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003805|I was worried you might get angry.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003804|I was worried you might get all angry again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003802|I'm glad to hear it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003801|I don't care if you steal from the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003797|And, I only take the scraps from around the edges.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003796|Just when I'm desperate. I just want to stay alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003795|Not that often. I'm not suicidal. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003794|Why?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003793|How often do you steal from the Fort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003791|You should give Doc his chems back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003790|I mean would you want an old man to live on just garbage?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003787|I'm staying alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003786|You're stealing from the Fort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003785|I found a huge package of chems hidden at Docs! They should be worth shards. He sells them for a fortune.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003784|And...I might have something for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003783|Be inventive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003782|But, even here, I have to look for things.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003781|I used to live out there. That's really hard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003780|Better pickings here than out in the desert.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003779|You live on trash?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003778|Cindy gave you up, she knows you're stealing from the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003777|If you get the taste!|With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003776|The old Doc can sell you more. When you want them. When you need them.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003759|Outlaws steal... they steal often and steal a lot.|Pointing out the obvious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003758|Then, we'll have to speak to the Outlaws around the Fort... |Figuring things out
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003757|Shit... Shit..|Upset
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003756|No, no, that can't be.|Upset
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003755|Scrappy is the thief.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003754|Cindy can tell us who the thief is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003753|Right. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003751|Last I heard he was still hanging about below the Fort, in a canyon where all the rubbish gets thrown. You should ask him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003750|Then you know who I mean.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003749|I've met Scrappy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003747|He hangs about below the Fort, in a canyon where all the rubbish gets thrown.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003746|Where can I find Scrappy?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003745|But, suddenly, he's selling top grade chems to some of my customers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003744|It's a guy called Scrappy, he normally deals in small scale salvage.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003743|Tell me what you know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003742|Yeah, but...I've heard of some good quality chems coming from somewhere else. Maybe, that's someone selling the doc's stuff?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003741|I know of no chems, lips, sealed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003740|Good, I need to get those chems before anyone else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003739|It's as good as forgotten.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003738|Good. Keep that information to yourself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003737|So, he might have taken them, or found them.|Unconvinced
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003736|He does steal things sometimes, as well as scavenging...|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003735|You think Scrappy took them?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003734|Maybe, they're the stolen chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003733|No idea, he mostly makes a living out of the garbage in the canyon, so unless someone threw the chems out, I don't know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003732|Where does Scrappy get the chems?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003731|Some have been turning up with chems from Scrappy recently.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003730|Mostly from the Doc, but...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003729|Where do your customers buy their chems?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003728|Okay, I will.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003727|Let me know if you think of anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003726|Are you sure?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003725|No, I don't think anyone's been talking about them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003724|Stolen chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003723|Doc's chems were stolen. Have you heard anything about them?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003722|Here are your shards back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003721|Well, it was worth a shot.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003720|Oh...well that's all I have.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003719|We both need the shards, he certainly doesn't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003718|Thanks. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003717|I already know where those shards are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003716|I'll give you the coordinates.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003715|He knows I don't leave the Fort, so he let slip where he put them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003714|So he's hidden his shards from her.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003713|She's started threatening revenge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003712|A guy I know has had a row with his wife, he's been coming to the entertainment district too often.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003711|Well, I have heard something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003710|I'm looking for anything that might make me some Elexit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003709|And, I need shards, so let's make a deal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003708|I need some information...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003703|It seems we're not safe anywhere.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003702|Ragnar's going to have to find me replacement guards. We're losing men, we're losing expertise, we're losing!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003701|Dead? Was he killed by the rotboars?|Coming to terms with this, rotboars is him realising the cause from the ealrier conversation
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003700|I should go now. I have to make this work!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003699|You will get more juice. I promise.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003698|I can show everyone the way, we can win this war. All this can be over. You believe me right? So, let's keep this between ourselves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003696|You know, yes I do. I want to see the Seedlings live. I want to see more World Hearts. I just wish the others could see how I could help them achieve that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003695|Whatever the truth, regrets won't change facts. Thank you for looking into it for me.|Resigned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003694|Or, perhaps I should have been more attentive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003693|Well, maybe, I was imagining an issue where there was nothing...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003692|Indeed?|Unsure
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003691|You should forget about Orik. There's nothing to worry about.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003689|But, if you want to live in the past, and keep us all in the past. You do that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003688|Eisenfaust wouldn't have defeated the Clerics if we we'd rejected Elex and hadn't discovered magic. They saw the future!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003687|But, remember, Amrek didn't conform when he founded the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003686|Well, you, Caldrim and Angrim can live by the Law.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003685|Ah, so you are one of them too.|Disappointed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003684|What you are suggesting is against the Law.|Firm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003683|We could try giving them different doses of Mana, planting the Seedlings somewhere there is a concentration of Elex, crossbreeding them...|Seeing he might not be in trouble and letting enthusiasm overwhelm his concerns.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003682|But, there are lots of things we could try.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003681|Me? Well, it couldn't be me, it would need a decision by someone of rank, with permission, of course.|Defensive, hiding something.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003680|He forgets that Amrek broke the rules. And, look where the rules have got us recently. Mutants attacking us. Albs rising in power. We have to fight back and we can't let rules get in the way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003679|He is strict about everything that comes down the ages from Amrek.|Down
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003678|Caldrim? He would probably exile me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003677|If feeding Mana to plants in these doses can make World Hearts, what would happen if we got the dose right with people?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003676|And that's just the Seedlings. There've not been many experiments on people since some narrow minded Warlord banned them. I think we should...at least talk about trying that again.|Still slightly wary, stopping short of admitting what he's been doing, despite his enthusiasm.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003675|Have you told Caldrim these ideas?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003674|How do you think you can improve the Seedling crop?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003673|It sounds like you really care about your job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003672|They've been learning how to cultivate more World Hearts since then, but it's hard. Even since they learned to feed them with Mana.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003671|I heard they were going to destroy it because it was, you know, a mutant plant. Then they realized...This thing was making everything else grow!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003670|I don't know. I mean Berserkers have been studying them since before I was born. I think they found one out in the wild.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003669|Why are World Hearts so rare?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003668|The occasional bit of grief from the boss, but nothing too bad. You know. Nothing worth talking about.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003667|The low success rate in growing World Hearts.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003665|The mutants.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003664|Just the usual.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003663|He cuts me some slack, gives me some time of my own. That gives me chance to, well do some experiments some times. Just try a few things to see if I can help the Seedlings.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003661|He is a good boss. I enjoy working with him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003660|Which is crazy. I mean imagine what we could do. And, not just to Seedlings. If Mana does that to a plant imagine what it could do to a person? If we don't try, we won't progress.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003659|Yeah. I mean, if we can't grow many World Hearts, we should try growing them differently. Maybe, we could breed them so the mutants wouldn't eat them. But, we're not allowed to try. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003658|Is there a way to stop the mutants from eating the plants?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003657|You think the first Cultivators just stood and watched things grow? The first mages just waited for magic? No, they tried things. They experimented.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003656|Caldrim is pretty strict about how the plants are grown and what you do with them and, well, how are we going to learn like that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003655|Yeah.. So, yeah... Well, it's not always so easy.|Thinking it through
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003653|First you get talking and then you tell me that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003652|And, if you don't have anything else to say, then I have work to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003651|Forget it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003650|You can tell him I'm okay. I'm fine and there are no problems.|Trying to talk the player out of investigating.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003649|He does? Okay... Apology accepted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003648|Caldrim knows there's something wrong. Whatever it is, it's better you tell me about it now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003647|I am sorry I didn't tell you. I'm not here as a spy. Caldrim was worried. He is concerned about you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003646|I don't talk to spies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003645|What do you want from me?|Hostile, suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003644|Get out of here, leave me alone!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003643|Are you just here to spy on me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003642|Shit? I don't know. I don't know why would he say something like that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003641|That's what I'm here to ask you. Why do you think he's worried?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003640|Problem, what problem? Why would there be a problem?|Edgy, nervous, something to hide
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003639|Caldrim sent me. He said there might be a problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003638|And is everything all right out here? There's nothing getting you down?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003637|What do you think of Born?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003636|Are you happy working for Caldrim?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003635|World Hearts, proper World Hearts are rare, but maybe, just maybe one of these little things will make it to maturity.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003634|Not that these little baby Seedlings are World Hearts yet. But, now Born's had the Mana delivery from Caldrim we can start cultivating them again and then...Who knows? |Proud, caring
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003633|Happy? I've got the most important job in Goliet. Hey, maybe even on Magalan. Protecting the Seedlings, that's the Law. World Hearts are to be protected from everyone and everything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003632|So, your job is to protect these plants from mutants? Are you happy out here doing that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003631|Whatever it is, he's served us well and, if there is something wrong, I'd like to help him. I don't want him to be afraid to tell me of problems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003630|But, maybe that's it. Maybe, he's seeking promotion, or maybe he's just having a bad day.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003629|He is someone who loves what he does. You should have no trouble getting him talking about his work in the Seedling fields. It has long been a passion of his.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003628|Just talk with him, see if you get the same feeling. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003627|How can I find out what's wrong?|Uncertain how he is supposed to make a difference
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003626|Yes, I get to hear all sorts. Tell, me what do you want to know, but don't expect to get the information for free.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003625|Pillow talk you mean?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003624|You must hear a lot of things. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003623|But, you have done him and the Berserkers a service. You have my pledge, should you need it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003622|A brother's love. Kral must have thought he was saving Grimar, but to live as an abomination, twisted by Elex? Sometimes, love blinds us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003621|Kral must be returned and his brother saved from his misery.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003620|Thank you for finding them. I will send men to deal with this problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003619|His will rotted by the Elex, he must now be as mindless as one of the Alb's mutants.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003618|Then his brother is dead. Even if it is a living death.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003617|His brother didn't die, but he was changed. This is why Kral took the Elex, he has been feeding it to his brother to keep him alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003616|His brother is dead, he was killed in a Converter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003615|He is hiding there with his brother.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003614|Yes, he is the old mausoleum.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003612|You know this for sure?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003611|Kral is in hiding.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003610|So, will you help me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003609|I know we all need to pay our way in the world.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003608|Then, I can offer you payment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003607|Then, if you decide to join us, that will open the way for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003606|If it is shards that would help motivate you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003605|I can put in a good word for you with the Warlords.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003604|Honest labor deserves reward.|Accepting this
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003603|The searches for him and the Elex have come up empty and I have no idea why he would take the Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003602|I can find Kral for you. For a price.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003601|While the guards might have been there already, they aren't the best of investigators, maybe you will have more fortune if you looked there.|Diplomatic
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003600|Kral spent a lot of time up there, sitting out on the main balcony. He's a thinker.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003599|The guards tried Ragnar's stronghold at the top of Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003598|Well, that is the question isn't it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003597|Maybe. Where would I need to start looking for Kral?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003596|That makes you a rare individual.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003595|It seems to me that you have freed yourself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003594|An Alb is a man who has become a slave to Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003593|One sign of you giving in to the temptation of Elex and I will be forced to report you. If this world gives in to Elex, it will consume us all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003592|The power it offers? Resist it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003591|She is dosed with Elex, she has it in her veins as you did.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003590|It is the struggle Magalan suffers from too.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003589|And from that curse, we bring the blessing of Mana.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003587|We cure Magalan from the curse of Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003586|Perhaps not Amrek's best choice of name, but we're in the habit of using it now.|Admitting the confusion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003585|Ah, well, you will find 'healers' among us, but you will learn we also use the name for those who heal Magalan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003584|You're healers here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003583|Saving our world. The only work that matters.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003582|Speak now. Or have you taken a vow of silence?|Jovial
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003581|Or, are you here in search of a healer?|Jovial
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003580|Talk to her, she might know something about who's trying to deal my chems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003579|She'll even talk to me!|With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003578|And, Cindy is the best one to talk to out of all of them. She's got less attitude than the others. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003576|Go to the girls in the entertainment district. The girls know everything. |With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003575|Do you have any leads?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003574|We'll have to find the thief.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003573|If you want to buy something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003572|But, you... You could help me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003571|Well, everything. My entire stock. Gone... just gone. Everything gone... Pff...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003570|Before he can start delivering again... hheehe|With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003569|Now, the old Doc has to make enough stuff again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003568|I was only gone for a little while. Taking care of something... |With a giggle
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003567|No, no, no idea.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003566|What was stolen?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003565|Who robbed you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003564|I've been robbed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003563|Nothing at the moment. Not a sizzling second of release.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003562|What do you have to offer?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003561|He's a hunter, so sometimes he gives me something he's caught.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003560|Sometimes, things I can trade with Rider, he buys things so I can get food.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003559|Sometimes, food.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003558|They throw out all sorts from the Fort, enough to live on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003557|On the gifts from the lords above. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003556|How do you survive out here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003555|You're not going to do it easily, you bastard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003554|You want to kill me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003553|You're a waste of skin. You might as well die.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003552|I don't hear that word too much.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003551|Sorry? You're...|Surprised.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003550|To say sorry.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003549|What do you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003548|I would like to speak with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003547|Leave me alone. Leave me to starve.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003546|What do you want from me? You don't even think I'm a person, do you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003545|Just get out of here. I would have thought I was speaking to a person here, it seems I'm not. So, you can get out, get out!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003544|Smug bastard, I bet you've never struggled for anything in your life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003543|Hey. Don't get angry. I'm starving to death out here. We can't all get lucky like you. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003542|Can I do something? You can pay me for it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003541|Just a few? I've not found anything out here, not today.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003540|We've got to help each other out here. Do, you need my help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003539|Thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003538|Stop begging. I'm not giving you anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003537|No, I don't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003536|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003535|A few shards then? You can spare some shards, yeah?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003534|No. I don't have anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003533|We've got to help each other out here. Do you need my help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003532|Yeah, thanks. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003531|Here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003529|A can, something, anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003528|Can you spare something to eat?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003527|Hey, hey.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003526|Let me know when you are ready.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003525|Yeah, we should take some of the crates the Albs left. We might as well take some supplies back with us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003520|All right, I'll take you back to the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003519|I will go back to Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003517|You are right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003516|I am just not interested in all the chems and fighting.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003515|You know... I have been thinking that for awhile.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003514|What are you trying to say? That I am too weak to live among the Outlaws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003513|If you can't manage to get back to the Fort alone...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003512|What? How so?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003511|If you want to survive, you shouldn't go back to the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003510|See you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003509|Thanks, maybe I should go to Abessa instead of the Fort...maybe I'll see you there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003508|I never liked it here in the desert anyways.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003507|Shit. Yeah, maybe you are right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003506|Do you really think it would go that far?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003505|I'm not paying you, I'm giving you a hand. If you go back to the Fort, Hank will kill you. He doesn't want witnesses.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003504|What, why would you pay me to go?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003503|Here, take this. You had better get out of here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003502|Maybe, I'll see you in Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003501|Thanks for the warning.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003500|Maybe, I can find a better life here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003499|I will go to Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003498|Fuck the Fort and fuck the Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003497|You're right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003496|I...right. If they don't want the truth, if they left me out here then...Abessa, yes, Abessa|Confused then being persuaded
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003495|No, you will be safer in Abessa than the Fort.|Using suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003494|No, he mustn't understand, he must think there was an accident, or something. We have to tell him the truth.|Insistent
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003493|No, people have to know. I have to tell them all, even if it's the last thing I do.|Insistent
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003492|Are you serious? Shit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003491|I see. But, I have orders. No witnesses|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003490|Your boss wants you to stay quiet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003489|We have to tell everyone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003488|People have to know the routes aren't safe anymore, or they'll walk into the same Alb ambush.|Insistent
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003487|But, why shouldn't we tell anyone else?|confused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003485|Maybe, we should take some of the crates the Albs left. We might as well take some supplies back with us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003484|Yeah. I should report back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003483|You want to get back to the Fort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003482|If you tell anyone you are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003481|Hank doesn't want people to know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003480|We have to get back and inform the Fort that the supply routes to Abessa aren't safe anymore.|Dutiful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003479|Then why didn't you say?|Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003478|Hank sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003476|And, they will and they can trust him. You see I've shifted the supply route and the supplies are getting through. So, it's ended well for everyone, yeah?|Making an argument. Seeking to persuade.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003475|Remember, Albs had nothing to do with it. Our supply lines are secure. People can trust the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003474|Truth is found in shards. So, here's some truth for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003473|And, it's best you stay quiet about this. That's the truth of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003472|Since you didn't do your job properly, the Duke isn't going to want to pay you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003471|Good, I knew I could rely on you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003470|But, don't worry, he won't cause you any trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003469|A runner called Kid survived. He saw the whole thing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003468|Ah, I see. You must be mistaken. There was no attack. There were no Albs. It was all an accident. Understand?|Spelling it out slowly with an edge of threat. I.e. Deny the truth!
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003467|The caravan was attacked by Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003466|What happened, exactly?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003464|I am ...disappointed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003463|You claimed you'd deal with this, but now people know the Albs attacked our caravan, they're worried and worry doesn't help the Duke.|Disapproving
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003462|But, you should've found a way to keep his mouth shut.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003461|Now, I know you said you didn't want to lie for me...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003460|Bringing Kid back here. That was not a smart move. That was something the Duke might find disappointing.|Disapproving
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003459|Crates speak only of success. The Duke will welcome them.|Positive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003458|I've got the crates from the missing caravan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003457|Sure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003456|Oh, did I say nothing? If you find a few good crates, you should bring those to me. Crates good. Witnesses, bad. Right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003455|So, go and check out the caravan's last known locations and come back to me with a report. A report and nothing and no one else.|Emphasis on no one.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003454|I'm sure you will be discreet and help save lives, by protecting the truth.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003453|I will put my trust in you wholeheartedly. The magnanimous, gracious and tolerant Duke... Will put his trust in you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003452|I'm sure you can find a way to make this discreet and help save lives, by protecting the truth.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003451|I'll put my trust in you. The magnanimous, gracious and tolerant Duke... Will put his trust in you.|Ending in an edge of threat.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003450|Then the Duke's gratitude will rain on you as it rains on us all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003449|I will look for the caravan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003447|That's why the strong like you and the Duke must protect them from the truth. Even if it means keeping our mouths shut.|Hardline
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003446|Not just those souls in the caravan, but those here at home. The truth, the wrong sort of truth can hurt such vulnerable people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003444|Look. This is about protecting those that need protecting. This is about protecting the weak and the helpless.|Appealing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003443|I don't think you're the right person for this job.|Unhappy
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003442|Then...|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003440|If it was one of our own people, an Outlaw who did it, you see? That's why we need discretion. In fact, we need to be discreet, whoever did this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003439|I'm hiding nothing, I just don't want this getting out yet. Not yet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003438|I'm not lying for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003437|Respect the Duke and the Duke will respect you. And, you'll get paid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003436|Pay me and I'll be as discreet as you want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003435|Discreet? What are you trying to hide?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003434|You see, I need someone to find it and I need someone who can be...discreet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003433|And as you are no Outlaw, you'd be perfect.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003431|Are you a fighting man? Our caravan delivering supplies to Abessa has disappeared.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003430|Well, there's talk that will see you advance here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003429|So, how can I help you serve the Duke?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003427|Thank you for trying though.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003426|Kral was a loyal man. I find it hard to believe he would have taken the Elex. I fear something ill has befallen him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003425|Then the mystery remains.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003424|There is no sign of Kral that I can find.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003423|Well, the guards sent after him failed in that task too. Did you find anything new?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003422|I couldn't find Kral.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003421|The Duke is generous. The Duke is forgiving. Forget this matter, for the Duke.|Praise, with the hook of a threat at the end.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003420|Those are the facts and there the matter ends.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003419|Kid killed himself with his own actions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003418|Kid is dead.|Matter of fact
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003417|You killed Kid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003416|Fucking shit. That is enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003415|What's wise about letting people get killed by Albs? That makes no sense.|Confused, upset
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003414|Kid, you're a Runner, you don't understand these things, leave them to older and wiser heads, yeah?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003413|But, we can tell the Duke, can't we? We should shouldn't we?|Insistent
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003412|If the people knew we were having trouble with supplies, there could be an uprising against the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003411|Damnit, Kid! Shut your mouth!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003410|We have to tell people, they have to know...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003409|You want to trumpet that any louder?|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003408|Psssht. Are you crazy?|Trying to get him to be quiet
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003407|Our caravan was attacked by Albs...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003406|Hey Hank! Bad news.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003405|The people here must know that our supply routes between the Fort and Abessa are not safe anymore.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003404|I will go to Hank immediately and give him a report.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003403|I will never leave the Fort again. You can bet your life on that!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003402|Here, this is everything I can thank you with.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003401|Man, I can't believe I got out of that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003400|You go, I'll follow you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003399|Thanks, thanks. After that attack. I don't feel confident getting back on my own.|Nervous.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003398|I will help you get back to the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003397|Please, you have to help me. I've got to get back so I can report to Hank.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003396|I'm lucky the Albs haven't found me and that the jackals haven't eaten me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003395|I need to get back to the Fort, but there's no way I can get back there alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003394|Can I come with you?|Still stressed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003393|Good job you came and let me know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003392|Well, then I won't be able to take care of my job if Hank is gone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003391|At least then I'd get some decent guns.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003390|Shit. I should have joined the Clerics.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003387|Hank is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003384|What are you going to do now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003383|And, I had to watch as the whole caravan was butchered.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003382|But, instead, they went and sent me out here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003381|I thought I could do some easy work in the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003380|Shit. I was just promoted to Runner.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003378|I was able to hide just in time.|Still stressed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003377|How did you survive?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003376|It was. ..it was. . .it didn't take them two minutes to kill everyone.|In shock, reliving it.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003375|We'd just left Abessa on the way back to the Fort when they attacked us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003374|They attacked our caravan, wiped us out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003372|What Albs?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003371|You'd better be careful, they were round here only a few days ago, they might still be here.|Jumpy
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003370|Have you seen any Albs out there?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003369|Hey, hey. . .stop, please stop.|Desperate
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003368|I have to take care of my brother.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003367|The Duke's generosity knows no bounds. But, strictly one set of rations a day and no more. Okay, friend?|Speaking grandly and then contradicting himself
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003366|Just don't eat it all at once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003365|Trust in the Duke and the Duke will provide.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003363|I'm here for my rations.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003362|Right. Thanks.|Neutral
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003361|But...just to show you the generosity of the Duke on this occasion, take this gift and know of his greatness.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003360|But, it's good to know we're clear for now. That was a job done well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003358|There'll be more. The smell the meat on the wind. Even animals can smell profit.|Sour
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003357|The creatures at the gate are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003356|I should have sent more men to the gate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003355|Shit. It seems I under estimated the problems they were having.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003354|Bullet and Lucy are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003353|Thanks for bringing those reinforcements, I owe you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003352|Never stop watching. Not if you want to stay alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003351|You'll need supplies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003350|Oh, you'll want to come in inside sooner, or later.|Straightforward, factual
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003349|Uhh...I'm not sure I want to go in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003348|We deal with any creatures that approach the Fort. You know, we stop them eating people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003347|So, I guess you can do the same.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003346|Whatever you said to William, was bullshit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003344|My poor Bullet...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003343|Just leave me in peace. I told you, don't make friends in Tavar.|Upset
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003342|Keep your eyes open. It is dangerous here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003341|Don't make friends. Thanks. Now, piss off and leave me alone.|Hiding her feelings
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003340|Idiot forgot the first rule of Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003339|Fuckwit didn't say a thing while he was alive.|Upset.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003338|Bullet, you ass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003337|Dear Lucy... hmm... I am writing this letter... Your Bullet...|Reading. Skipping sections to keep them private
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003336|Show me. Let me read.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003335|He is dead. I found this with his body.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003334|Really? Is... Is he...?|Dreading the answer
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003333|I found Bullet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003332|All right. I've got it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003331|That's got to be where Bullet is now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003330|Those things must have a nest in a canyon there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003329|That dragon mantid dragged Bullet away to the west.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003328|Don't expect them to give a shit about you when you're in trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003327|And, you...just remember, if you don't give a shit about other people...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003326|I'll look for him myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003325|Then get out of here. If you don't you are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003324|Good. Thank you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003323|No, it doesn't make sense to look for a body.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003322|Okay, I'll look for him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003321|You caused this. You need to look for him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003320|I need to know what happened to him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003319|If you only find a body, that's a start.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003318|He at least deserves us to try.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003317|No, I'm not looking for him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003316|Okay, I'll look for him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003315|It's useless. Bullet is dead by now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003314|You're going to look for Bullet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003312|He didn't have a chance. And, that's all your fault.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003311|It dragged him away.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003310|One of those dragon mantids grabbed Bullet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003307|Then whose is it? You should have tried harder to convince him. Whatever you said ended with Bullet being dragged away. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003305|What happened?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003304|What do you mean “dragged away”?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003303|It isn't my fault William sent so few men.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003301|Now, Bullet has been dragged away and all because you didn't get us enough men.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003300|Hey, you! You're the guy Bullet sent to William for reinforcements, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003298|Either, you draw the line, or someone else will end up owning you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003297|You've got to know what you want, what you're prepared to put up with.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003296|Either way, you're alive. That makes you a survivor.|Grudging admiration
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003295|So, take this and get out of here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003294|You've earned your pay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003293|Someone who actually understands duty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003292|Now, that is good to see. |Pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003291|You spot a threat, you kill it on sight. Are we clear?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003290|Don't leave your post unless it's to deal with an enemy and then, you come right back here afterwards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003289|The Fort isn't a place to dither.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003288|Or, are you just a troll? You'll plough through obstacles until you get killed?|Assessing player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003287|You're still alive, so you must have been getting the balance right.|Compliment, assessing player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003286|Other times, you have to make a stand.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003285|Sometimes you have to dance the way they want you to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003284|Everyone gets their strings pulled here in the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003283|It seems like you're getting messed around.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003282|You seem pretty certain of yourself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003277|What does it look like?|Wry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003276|Does this place get attacked a lot?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003275|You're fired. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003274|If you go wandering off and leaving the Fort unprotected, you won't get any more work from me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003273|I told you to stay on watch. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003271|Sure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003270|Is William only sending us the dumbest guys in Tavar?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003269|Hey! You ass!|Angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003268|You will eat here, sleep here, piss here, until you are told otherwise, clear?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003267|You're to take over on watch.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003266|But, whatever. Come here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003265|Really? I mean you don't look like the reinforcements I was expecting.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003263|That was too much to hope for.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003262|Right, of course, not.|Frustrated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003261|Yes. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003260|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003259|Rest well, Bullet, I hope you find profit in whatever life comes next.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003258|If only he'd sent enough men in the first place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003257|Fucking William.|Frustrated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003256|Too many of the good ones are getting killed and leaving assholes in their place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003255|Fuck. I wanted to know, but now I wish I didn't.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003254|Bullet is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003253|Are you our reinforcements?|Disappointed it's just them
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003252|So, you might just have saved my ass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003251|There more of us there are, the less chance there is of me lining some monster's digestive tract.|Straightfoward
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003250|Every man counts.|Cool
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003248|Good.|Cool
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003247|I got you your reinforcements.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003246|Tell Bullet he will get his reinforcements.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003245|Four men it is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003243|But, you look like someone who knows their way round the wilderness, so I'll agree.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003242|That sounds excessive. |Reluctant
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003241|You can tell Bullet and Lucy, they will get their reinforcements.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003240|Okay, three men.|Moment of agreement
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003239|Hmmm. Sounds like you know your way round the wilderness.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003238|Tell Lucy and Bullet their reinforcements are on the way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003237|I can spare two.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003236|Yes, you are probably right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003235|Consider it taken care of.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003234|Fine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003233|Is that all?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003232|One?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003231|You need to get them four men. That's if you want that gate secured.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003230|Three men. Any less and you'll just get men killed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003229|Two should be enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003228|One should be enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003227|That will have to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003226|I'll send him two men.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003225|That means he doesn't know.|Dismissive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003224|He says as many as possible.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003222|Because, when we're dead, the streets will be full of creatures and they'll be coming to gaw off his nutsacks next.|Cool calm, straight forward
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003221|How many men does he need?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003220|I should've figured he couldn't handle it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003219|Right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00003218|Bullet needs reinforcements outside the gates.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002920|You know when you get that feeling? That you're going to have to find yourself another bodyguard?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002919|I knew that guy wouldn't last.|Irritated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002918|He's dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002917|What do you mean found?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002916|I found your bodyguard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002914|Then come back and tell me when he knows about Ryan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002913|Right|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002912|Sometimes he can be a little slow on the uptake.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002911|You could even suggest that he need to get a new bodyguard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002910|Just go to Blake and tell him you found Ryan's body.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002909|You need to tell Blake soon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002908|We've got this plan in action, so we should keep going before anything has chance to go wrong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002907|Well, yes. But, why?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002906|And, he is pretty used to his bodyguards dying on him one after the other.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002905|People get killed in Tavar all the time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002904|Yeah, so what if he does?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002903|He might suspect I killed him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002902|What? You mean that he's dead?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002901|Won't Blake think it's strange? Me telling him about the bodyguard?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002900|Can't we just wait?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002899|You had better do it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002898|It's going to be fishy if I turn up and tell Blake his bodyguard is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002897|So, done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002896|I've put my name on the list and got it in place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002895|Let me get the list into Blake's things.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002894|Right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002893|Let me get to Blake's and sort things out there, then let's talk about this again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002892|You'll have to give me time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002891|Already? That was quick.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002890|Ryan is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002889|Good. Then go. We will meet above at Blake's when everything has been taken care of.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002888|Okay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002887|See you up at Blake's.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002886|You take care of Ryan and I will become Blake's new bodyguard. Then. We will find out what's going on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002885|Then, once I'm in on the inside, I might find out what's going on with the protection racket.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002884|There I am at the top of the list he's been given.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002883|So, when Blake thinks about hiring someone new.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002882|I'll put my name on the list of bodyguard candidates.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002881|You go and take care of Blake's bodyguard Ryan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002880|Okay. Then go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002879|Run over the plan again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002878|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002877|Got it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002876|Trying to persuade him might just mean he speaks to Blake and then our chances will be blown.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002875|The idiot prides himself on being loyal. So, chances are you'll have to kill him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002874|You take care of Ryan in the meantime.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002873|After I've written my name on top of the list, I'll put it back in Blake's place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002872|You take care of Ryan and I'll take his place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002871|That's why I like you, friend, you can see how a plan works.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002870|Then, I take his place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002869|We kill Ryan of course. What else?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002868|I will do it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002867|But, no, that would be too suspicious.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002866|Hmm... you certainly could...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002865|How do we get Blake to want a new bodyguard?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002864|You want me to be Blake's bodyguard?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002858|By 'we' kill him, you mean you want 'me' to kill him?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002857|Then, we put the list back and give Blake a reason to hire someone new.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002856|So, we should change the name on top.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002855|The names on this list would be candidates to replace him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002854|If Blake's latest bodyguard Ryan was to die, or quit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002853|Hmmm... But, he may be part of the solution...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002852|No, Ryan isn't the problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002851|I mean, what would you talk to him about?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002850|Why should we do that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002848|Hmm... Yeah, that could actually work.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002847|What? No! Why would we...? You know that idea isn't so dumb at all...|Protesting then realising
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002846|Listen, my friend. I'll explain it to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002845|No. Seriously. We should leave Blake alive, but have some fun with him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002842|What? No, why do you always want to kill people? How's that going to earn us shards?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002841|Listen, my friend. I'll explain it to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002840|What's that going to achieve?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002839|What? No, absolutely not.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002837|We should talk to Ryan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002836|We should kill Ryan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002835|We have to kill Blake.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002834|Show Blake the list?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002832|Okay, then it's clear what we have to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002831|That idiot Cameron must've written this before he was killed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002830|Well, this seems to be a list of candidates for bodyguards for Blake.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002829|Bodie-gerds? Iren.. Iren.. Madi-sum? Ah, Iron Madison. Ri-ern? Ryan. You know whoever wrote this can't spell...|Reading the list, trying to work out what it means.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002828|Hmmm... I'm guessing it's a list of names, but with this writing..|Trying to read the list
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002827|A list? All right, let's see if it's anything useful.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002826|I found this list at Blake's.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002825|Let's get this over with.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002824|Ha, people have tried to kill me before, I'm still breathing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002823|I'm here to kill you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002822|Do I want to...? Actually, yeah, I've got some things to trade.|Starts annoyed then relaxes
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002821|Do you want to trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002820|This is the last shit I need on my time off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002819|I told you I'm out here on a break.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002818|I thought about it. I am going to punch you in the face.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002817|I just want to be left alone, okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002816|Does that answer your question?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002815|That's why I took the job. Plenty of free time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002814|And, when he goes on “business trips”.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002813|He only me takes me to watch his back when he goes ripper hunting.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002812|Aw, Blake doesn't need me as long as stays inside.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002811|What happens if he's killed while you are on a break?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002810|I'm just out here on a break.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002809|I'm Blake's bodyguard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002807|Sure, fine, whatever, just stand there without a word, I'll fill the void with words instead. Um...my day got strange when you arrived you know?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002806|Are you speechless now, or what?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002804|You're a weird one.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002803|Man, man...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002802|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002801|Are you serious?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002800|You've gone through all that to ask me...that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002799|What are you doing out here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002798|So...leave.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002797|That generally means you leave.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002796|I mean, I said 'fuck off' and you said 'okay'.|Working it through
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002795|Yeah, I'd never thought of it like that before.|Realising what this might mean
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002794|Maybe, it's a cry for help. Maybe, I don't really want to be alone.|Realising what this might mean
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002793|Fuck, you're right. I do ask a lot of questions...|Realising that he is asking more questions
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002792|What the fuck are you talking about?|Confused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002791|What?|Confused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002790|I just want to be left alone, okay?' 'So, fuck off, will you, yeah?' If you ask questions you must want answers.|Quoting him.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002789|What?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002788|If you want to be alone, why ask me a question?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002787|What you want from me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002786|Don't make it worse.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002785|Talk about what?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002784|Relax, I just want to talk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002783|So, I'm going to have to kick your ass again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002782|You still don't get it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002781|And, I said you could kiss my ass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002780|I told you you should fuck off.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002779|I've just been having a bad day.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002778|Alright. Alright.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002777|I'm trying to talk to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002776|Now, are you going to go?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002775|I thought you said you were going?|Changing his mind and talking to the player.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002774|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002773|Are you trying to start something?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002772|Say, why don't you fuck off yourself?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002771|Good. Right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002770|Okay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002769|So, fuck off, will you, yeah?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002768|I need someone who doesn't owe the Duke a favor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002766|Let's do some business. Are you ready to trade?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002765|Just let me know if you want to do some trading.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002764|No problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002763|Just don't use them all at once.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002762|You will get them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002761|Pleasure doing business with you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002758|Here, take these shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002757|Okay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002756|I'll take that discount.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002755|I want some grenades.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002754|Life - is about choosing sides.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002753|Just pay me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002752|Now, we're square, okay? You can take your land mines somewhere else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002751|Okay, okay. Here, take these shards. |Giving in
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002750|So, you want to play the hard man?|Considering the player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002749|Give me what I'm owed, or you'll get a personal demonstration of them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002748|So? What's that to me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002747|I can make you some landmines from these mines. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002746|I can't pay you much, though, I've already paid someone else to do the job you refused to do for me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002745|Okay, look, I'll pay you a few shards.|Relenting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002743|This had better not be some sort of a trick.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002742|All right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002741|A total dumbass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002740|Sure, I'll pay a thousand, I'm a total dumbass.|Repeating what he has been told, hypnotised
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002739|Sure, I'll pay a thousand, I'm a total dumbass.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002738|A thousand? What?! Do you think I'm a total dumbass?|Grumpy, grumbling
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002737|Pay me 1000 shards for them.|Read 1000 as 'a' thousand not '1' thousand.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002736|I changed my mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002735|And, I told you not to bring them here if you changed your mind.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002734|You said you weren't going to get them.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002733|What? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002732|So, what'll it be?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002731|And, now this deal is going through, I can afford to give you a discount on trade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002730|Or, is it Elexit you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002729|Do you want a share of these grenades?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002728|What do you want as your reward?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002726|Excellent, give them to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002725|I have the crates of grenades you want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002724|Sure. I'll get them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002723|You got that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002722|So, bring me three crates and then you can pick out a reward.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002721|Good decision.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002720|If I don't have them in time for the deal, I don't want goods like that sitting around for the Duke to trace back to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002719|But, if you change your mind, don't just decide to bring me the crates later.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002718|Like I said, your choice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002717|Very well, your loss.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002715|No, I don't want anything to do with this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002714|Yes, I'll get them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002713|So. are you going to get them for me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002712|About these grenades you want...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002711|Do you think you can handle that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002710|Just bring them here and don't let the Duke's men trace you when you do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002709|I don't care how you get them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002708|I need at least three crates of grenades from the Duke's stockpile.|Straightforward
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002706|You know my offer, you can make your choice.|Without a grudge
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002705|I won't force you.|Without a grudge
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002704|If you don't want to get the grenades you don't have to.|Without a grudge
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002703|I thought you said not to cross the Duke?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002702|So, what do you need me for?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002699|Normally, that's fine, there's room for us both. Only right now I've got a bulk deal going through, but only if I can get some grenades to complete the list of things he wants.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002698|That makes us competitors.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002697|Arms trading is one of his businesses.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002695|Okay, so, details. The Duke has a weapons cache. I say cache, but I mean a stockpile.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002694|Are you ready for a tricky task?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002693|That's you, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002692|Can you handle that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002691|It's got some risk attached to it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002690|What do you mean a 'free agent'?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002689|Tell me the details and I'll decide.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002688|Are you up for earning yourself a reward?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002687|But, if you're an outsider...I have a job for a free agent.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002685|And, it runs in the family. That sister of his is smart too. And, tough enough to get the men to follow her. That should tell you everything you need to know. A real leader.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002683|Logan took the Fort and he took charge. He's smart and strong enough to have risen to the top. |Gruff admiration
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002681|Tell me more about the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002680|Take my advice and stop asking questions. The Duke won't like it and if Baxter is still alive, it's not like he's doing anything to defend his own name is it? Let him fade into the past.|Sour, let down
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002679|Whatever the truth, no one's heard from him since Nasty took the Fort and the Duke took control.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002678|Others say that he was shot in the back of the head and is buried out there in the sands.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002676|There are some who say that Baxter is everywhere and nowhere. that he has spies, eyes and ears everywhere.|Not believing it
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002675|Why do you want to know? He's gone. No one knows where he is.|Annoyed that Baxter has run off. Grim
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002673|Tell me about Baxter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002671|Lies like that will get you in trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002670|You think turning up here and spreading lies is a good idea?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002668|You'd better think again. Tread lightly and it will go better for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002667|If you machine loving freaks are planning to start trouble here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002665|I don't have anything to say to a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002663|So, you'd better stop spreading this sort of rumor. Got it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002661|I'm not accountable to a Berserker.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002660|We all know what we are doing. We can all let each other get on with each other's business.|Persuasive, calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002659|Just forget it. Alright?|Persuasive
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002658|As far as you're concerned, I'm not running any sort of protection money.|Persuasive, calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002656|If that's the case, you shouldn't ask questions that could mess up someone's business.|Edge of threat
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002654|You said that you're on Baxter's side?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002652|Get that clear.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002650|I am not running a protection racket, okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002649|If you are spying for the Duke then you can tell him that is bullshit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002648|You said you were with the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002647|Be careful with your accusations, friend...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002646|You're forcing Chloe to pay protection money.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002645|So, what do you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002644|Clerics and Outlaws, that's added up to a lot of deaths over the years.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002641|Let's just say they aren't popular here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002640|They let some Clerics in here, for trade, but...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002637|Well, yes, but I wouldn't go shouting that out too loud.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002636|You've got to look at the bigger picture.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002635|Look, trees are fine, but there's not much profit in them is there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002634|Yeah, you look like a damned spirit of the forest.|Disparaging
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002633|Life under bloody Baxter's rule matched his name, it was bloody. The Duke, with Nasty helping him with planning, well, they've changed things here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002632|Don't take people's word for anything until you've got the facts, yeah?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002631|Then you should try and get the full picture.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002630|Really? No one? Well, as you're new here...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002629|You're just another fish that swims with the stream are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002627|So, you're for Logan?|Bitter
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002626|Some would say you're living in the past, my friend, that you should think before that gets you killed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002625|Well, there are those who would say you are a man of integrity. There aren't many here who still side with the old guard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002624|Nobody sent me, I am a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002623|Nobody sent me, I am a Berserker.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002622|I'm not 'with' anyone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002621|You didn't think the Duke's name was just 'the Duke', did you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002620|Logan's the Duke!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002619|You don't know who Logan is?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002618|So, they say. But, you will have to decide how much of that is true.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002617|And, then the Duke sent jackals out after him. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002616|From the Duke. Logan kicked Baxter out of the Fort and took over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002615|Ran from what?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002614|Pulled their innards out through their throats and yet a man as brave as that turned and ran.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002613|They say he killed over a dozen jackals with his bare hands.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002612|Baxter the Bloody! He founded the camp here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002611|You really aren't from around here are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002610|Who is Logan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002609|Who is Baxter?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002608|What if I say The Duke?|Neutral
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002607|What if I say Baxter?|Neutral
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002605|Are you with Bloody Baxter, or Logan 'The Duke'?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002604|Hmm... I don't recognize your face.|Considering the player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002602|Make sure Blake stops his demands, or someone else pays.|To business
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002601|Wait, there is.|False realisation - the player can do it
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002600|So, she can get the shards to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002599|Just get the shards to Chloe.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002598|I don't care which.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002597|If only there was someone with an interest in making sure the Duke got his shards.|Turning to the player - pointed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002596|Blake? Dammit, is there anyone in this Fort who isn't trying to take behind the Duke's back?|Surprised
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002595|Blake is demanding protection money from her.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002594|I know why Chloe can't pay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002593|I'll see you there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002592|I am going back to Chloe's bar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002591|Then we'll figure out the next step.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002590|Look through Blake's stuff and come back to me when you've found something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002589|Follow the Rat's plan and you'll come out ahead, my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002588|You know I found all this out to help you. So, now it's your turn to do something, friend. I can't carry all this plan on my own!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002587|I don't have to help you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002586|Hey, did William tell you, or me to collect the tribute? I'm trying to help you get the money Chloe owes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002585|Why don't you go and find the information?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002584|Okay, I'll look for the proof at Blake's house.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002582|Then we can sort this all out to our benefit. Chloe gets freed from Blake, we get the shards we need.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002581|Three of them have died in the last two months. But, if anybody knows why, nobody is saying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002580|We just need some hint. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002579|We need to go through his things and find out why. There has to be some dirt there and we can use it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002578|Despite all his influence, he's being going through bodyguards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002577|We should focus on Blake.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002576|I mean, you're free to do what you want, but when that goes badly, remember that Rat has a plan to sort this out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002575|She's in enough trouble without having William question why she's in charge of the entertainment district.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002574|And, sure, you could tell William, but that would make Chloe look weak.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002573|Speaking to the Duke is never a good idea.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002572|Killing him, trying to kill him, could land you in all sorts of shit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002571|He's also a pretty good fighter in his own right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002570|No, no, Blake is an influential guy, he's protected by a lot of people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002569|Are you crazy?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002568|If Blake's stopping the Duke getting his tribute, we should tell the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002567|So, what's the plan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002566|We should kill Blake.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002565|Otherwise, what's the point?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002563|We need to force him to forget about the protection money for good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002562|But, that would just mean he'd just come back later when he thought things had blown over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002561|If you approach him now, I've got no doubt he'd back off and leave Chloe alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002560|Before we go any further, let me make one thing clear. Under no circumstances should you speak to Blake.|Serious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002559|I wouldn't be Rat if I didn't, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002558|Ho, ho, slow down before you do something hasty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002557|How could you doubt the Rat?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002556|So, you finally got some information?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002555|I assume you already have a plan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002554|Okay, I will stop Blake.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002553|He's forcing Chloe to pay protection money.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002552|A guy called Blake is behind this. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002551|So, this is what I learned.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002550|Okay, I don't think anyone will overhear us here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002548|Come on, let's get somewhere we can talk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002547|The situation isn't exactly safe for anyone involved.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002546|I don't want everybody to hear what I am about to tell you.|Stage whisper
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002545|Walk with me a moment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002544|Hmmm... We shouldn't talk here...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002543|She can't pay the Duke, or anyone else, because she's already being bled dry.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002542|Chloe is being forced to pay protection money.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002541|Okay, so the truth is this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002540|And, are going to tell me the story?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002539|I mean, there has to be a story to be told.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002538|She can't cover the Duke's tribute.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002537|Yet, she's desperate to collect debt money, She's got no shards to spend.|Listing the facts
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002536|I mean she's in charge of the entertainment district, so she should have Elexit coming out of her ears, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002535|Why she can't pay the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002534|Just tell me the plan, Rat.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002533|What information did you get out of her?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002531|And, then some drink to get her talking.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002530|It just took a little time to get through to her.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002528|Chloe's finally opening up.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002527|And?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002526|Yes, the plan is forming.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002525|She's not just going to blurt out why she can't pay the Duke's tribute anymore.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002524|I'm not that fast. Just give me some time with her. I'm only just getting her trust.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002523|Hey, hey. Be patient|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002522|So, about your plan with Chloe...?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002521|Trust in the Rat, my friend!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002520|I should know more by then.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002519|You'll find me in Chloe's bar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002518|Come back in one, or two days.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002517|We need to follow the Elexit, but trust me, you don't want to know about the Duke's dealings.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002516|Just let me figure this out and we will all benefit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002515|The world is a complicated place, you can't expect answers to be straightforward all the time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002514|I won't, my friend. That's my point, we're all in this together.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002513|I will work on Chloe. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002512|But, to get the best plan, I need to know the facts.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002511|The Rat always has a plan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002510|No, this is about us. You, me and maybe Chloe. Mainly you and me, friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002509|That's still not an explanation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002508|Don't ever do anything behind my back again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002507|So, this is really about the Duke?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002506|The old Rat doesn't do things by halves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002505|So, what we need to do is work out where Chloe's Elexit is going and why. Then, we can help, her, you and me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002504|I mean technically the Duke owns everyone in the Fort, but you don't want to owe him too!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002503|And, if you can't pay him, the Duke owns you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002502|Chloe's treasure trove would never have covered her debt to the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002501|Which is beneficial.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002500|But, it's good that you trust the Rat. You know the Rat has your back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002499|I have Chloe's trust again. Well, I mean she doesn't completely hate me anymore.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002498|You are cold, do you know what? |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002497|Just like that? Just “That is good”?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002496|Hey, whoa, no. Hold your horses, okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002495|Advantageous? How?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002494|That is good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002493|What benefit was there for me? You screwed me over.|Cold
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002492|You're an asshole.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002491|It was advantageous for both of us that I told her.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002490|Zero benefit, I'd forget that idea entirely.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002489|Right, right, exactly!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002488|I don't gain anything from killing you. However tempting that might be.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002487|Now, it seems we need to find another plan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002486|I told you, I needed the shards I could generate from Chloe's treasure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002485|And, that is everything I have.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002484|You can rely on the Rat.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002483|I was already planning to pay you back, friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002482|Here's the fifty shards you gave me, plus a little extra.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002481|Relax, friend, relax.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002480|Let's start with you paying me. Then we can go from there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002479|And, keen minds see opportunity.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002478|That's the sign of a keen mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002477|It's great that you decided to talk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002476|Talk fast. Why did you betray me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002475|I didn't give you up for nothing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002474|Just, just let me explain, friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002473|Have you calmed down now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002472|Hch... Alright... Then draw your weapon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002471|I was afraid you might need to calm down first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002470|You're dead, asshole.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002469|I mean we're friends and I did that? But, there is an explanation, okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002468|Yeaaah, I told Chloe you wanted to rob her. And, you, have every reason to hate me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002467|Wait, wait, wait. Before you do anything hasty.|Talking fast
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002466|Sure? No. That's one reason why I want him found. To discover the truth.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002465|You're sure he stole the Elex?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002464|I found Kral.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002463|You sent the wrong men.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002462|That'd be good for both of us.|Tired
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002461|Let's just stay out of each other's way from now. Okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002460|Right, good. Someone who knows when to move on.|Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002458|I won't fight you again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002457|Fighting won't achieve anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002456|You think attacking me it going to get you somewhere?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002455|What's the point in going on with this?|Appealing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002454|I agree.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002453|No, I don't think so.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002452|All right, let's call this quits. Let's put it in the past and move on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002450|You must be stronger than you look.|Grudging
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002448|So it seems.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002447|And, yet here you are alive.|Frustated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002446|I met the men you sent to greet me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002445|And, wondering when Caldrim will give us orders to come back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002443|It's starting to feel like we've been exiled...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002442|So, here we are taking care of them and keeping watch.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002441|Caldrim sent us to do as sweep for exiles and the deserters, but what with the Albs, the other factions and the creatures, exiles are the least of our worries.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002440|Everything is trying to eat everything else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002439|Without the patrols to keep the wildlife under control out here it's gone crazy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002438|Just another way the Albs are killing us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002437|If you want to stay alive out here, just keep your eyes open.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002436|Keep your eyes open and walk wary.|One-liner if he has nothing more to say - warning
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002435|If you see anyone higher in rank than me, ask them when we're getting reinforcements, or going home will you?|One-liner if he has nothing more to say
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002434|Well, it looks like I'm stuck out here, doesn't it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002433|I'd give my right butt cheek to get out of here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002432|Did Kral, or anyone say they were replacing us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002431|How long are we going to have to wait out here?!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002430|Shit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002429|But, I guess I'll be seeing you in Goliet!|Excited to be going home.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002428|Finally, I was starting to think we'd been forgotten out here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002425|Yes. I've got orders for you. You're to return to Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002424|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002423|Did Caldrim send you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002422|Reinforcements, at last.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002421|What the fuck do you think you're doing down here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002419|Chloe sends her greetings!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002418|Hey, asshole!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002417|But, don't think this is over. This will have repercussions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002415|Fine, fine, I surrender, all right?|Tired, defeated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002414|First you steal. Now this. For fuck's sake...|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002413|What else do you want from me?|Tired, defeated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002412|But, don't try pulling that sort of shit again. Okay?|Tired of the same old BS
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002411|I'll count that as us being square.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002410|Learn the lesson.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002409|So, you survived?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002408|But, the two of us aren't done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002407|Hah, you ran like a kicked jackal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002406|That's not the way things are done here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002405|I gave you a way out, now you expect me just to let you go?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002404|I'm not paying you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002403|Do what you want with Rat.|Acknowledging that Rat might be involved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002402|Now both of you can get out of here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002401|So, if you decided to beat the shit out of him, at least he'll get some of the payback he deserves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002400|Mostly because he'd never have paid up, anyway.|Resigned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002399|I canceled his debts when he blew the whistle on you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002396|Just don't be an asshole again, please.|Reasonable
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002395|Consider us square. Debt cleared.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002394|Good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002392|I'll consider us square.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002391|All right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002390|But, maybe that was excessive.|Thinking it through, relenting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002389|I wanted a thousand.|1000 should be spoken as 'a' thousand. Firm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002388|Here's 100 shards.|100 should be spoken as  'a' hundred.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002387|Here are your shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002386|So, what'll be?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002385|This is Tavar, that's not how we do things.|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002384|A kiss on the cheek and a giggle at your roguish behavior?|scathing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002383|What did you expect?|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002382|I should be asking for a thousand, so take the deal and be grateful.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002381|But, this is my place and I can't let theft go unpunished, so...Give me 100 shards and we'll call it square.|100 should be spoken as 'a' hundred.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002380|I can see, you've got a point.|Surrendering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002379|Right...right...okay.|Thinking it over, considering it.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002378|I'm just making sure the Duke gets what he's owed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002377|This isn't personal.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002376|You owe the Duke money.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002375|So, here we are then...You're barred. You won't get a drink in this bar starting now. So, how about you get the hell out of here and don't come back.|Considering the player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002374|But, I can't let you go unpunished.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002373|I don't want to die either.|Considering the player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002372|You want to know the truth?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002370|That's your way out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002369|Another way? Okay. 1000 and we're square.|100 - spoken as 'a' thousand, considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002368|I know how this looks, but let me explain.|Charming Chloe.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002367|I don't want to kill you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002366|You want to fight me?|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002365|Is there another way we can sort this out?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002364|You're brave enough to steal, are you brave enough to fight?|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002363|I guess this is where we find out, isn't it?|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002362|What? You think I'm an easy mark? That I can't take care of myself?|Growing angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002360|As you're going to find out.|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002359|I decide what happens here.|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002358|This is my place.|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002357|Don't bullshit me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002356|Right? It was Rat's idea then he, what? Decided to accuse you at the point you were about to get away with it?|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002355|Problem? You're stealing from me. It's a good job Rat saw you.|Calm, but steely
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002354|Problem?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002353|Rat double crossed me. I'll kill that pig.|Realising the reason. Humane, emotional - 1 cold
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002352|This was Rat's idea.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002351|What's the problem?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002350|And you can get out too, Rat.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002349|Give that here!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002348|Hey! What, do you think you're doing? You think you can steal from me?|Called to the player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002347|There! There he is! That guy's trying to steal your stuff!|To Chloe
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002346|But, nothing. Get out of here before I have you thrown out in pieces. You've got a count of one. One.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002345|But, Chloe...|Appealing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002344|You're banned from here, Rat! Why can't you get that through your head?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002343|Wait, no, no, it's all of that, plus the lies, the raptorshit, the fast talking and the fact you're a grade A1 asshole.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002342|Or, no... Now, I remember, it was the fight you started here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002341|Or... wait, hold on... Maybe it was the things you stole from me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002340|I don't know, maybe it's the several thousand shards you owe me?|Isn't it obvious?
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002339|What did I do to deserve that welcome?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002338|Hey, why so unfriendly?|Friendly act
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002337|What do you want, Rat?|Cold, hostile
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002336|What do you want?|Friendly act
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002335|If you miss that opportunity, well then you will have to figure out how to do this yourself. Okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002333|But, that does mean you won't have long before her being 'mildly' annoyed moves to me being thrown out. So, be stealthy and be quick!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002332|Me turning up, well...we have a chemistry me and her. I only have to walk into a room and she's instantly pissed at me.|suggesting sexaul chemistry then revealing the truth
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002331|I'll distract Chloe so you get a straight, clear run to the cellar, right?|Talking fast as he walks
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002330|Then let's get going.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002329|Sure.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002328|Are you ready?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002327|You get in, you get out, the Rat takes care of the rest.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002326|She won't notice a thing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002325|I can keep Chloe talking while you get the job done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002324|We can make this happen, you and I.|Encouraging
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002323|But, I don't know another way to get you the shards she needs. Listen, you'll be helping her. Sure, she loses one way, but she will also get the shards she needs to get out of trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002322|Well, my friend. It's not about want. I don't want to steal from my good friend and respected lady either.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002321|I'm not going to steal from Chloe.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002320|The stuff we're after is in a trunk somewhere down there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002319|You get into the cellar under the bar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002318|I keep Chloe busy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002317|Could you go over the plan again?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002316|And, at the same time I will be free of my debt.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002315|We will pay her debts with her own valuables.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002314|But, be careful you don't get caught.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002313|Here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002312|Good decision, my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002311|Give me the key, I will get Chloe's stash.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002310|Simple, hey?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002309|So, we just need to get in, get the stash, get out, sell everything and suddenly...suddenly, you, me, Chloe and the Duke, we all end up happy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002308|You see, I have the key to her hidden stash.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002307|So, you see, as luck would have it for you, me and her, the Rat has already started working on a plan to untangle this whole mess.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002306|Who will would pay a handsome sum for the treasure trove Chloe's hidden in her cellar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002305|I know somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002304|I'm not suggesting she is lying, at least not a straight lie. She doesn't have a shard to her name. It's just she does have a different sort of wealth.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002303|Well...strictly speaking, she absolutely is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002302|What I want is...to redistribute her hidden wealth to everyone's advantage.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002301|Rob' is such an ugly word.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002300|And, you want to rob her?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002299|So, she's not broke?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002298|She might not have Elexit, but she's got her a stash, a treasure trove of gems and jewelry. Stuff she keeps as an emergency fund.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002297|Okay, okay, okay... So, this is just background. You see I did some more digging and the thing is....Chloe isn't broke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002296|How does this help us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002295|As long as the debt's kept quiet. You with me so far?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002294|Now, the Duke doesn't normally do debts, he's more the 'you owe me, pay now or die' kind of guy. But, it seems he's cutting her some slack.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002293|Unless...someone's got hooks into her. So, I did some digging and it seems she's run up a real debt with the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002291|So, this is how I see it. Chloe runs the entertainment district so there's no way she's not pulling in a lot Elexit, right? So, her being broke doesn't make sense.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002290|Just tell me your plan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002289|How so?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002288|But, I wouldn't be Rat if I didn't already have a plan!|Bouncing back
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002287|You see, the Rat has a plan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002286|The plan, on the other hand, is part of the bad news, my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002284|I am shardless except for the few that I got from you and those won't cover Chloe's bill.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002282|The bad news is this way is the only way I can think of getting the shards you want.|Stress on only
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002281|In fact I know where we can get enough to settle my debt and more.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002279|Well, the good news is I can help you get the shards you want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002278|The good news is that I do know where you can get the shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002277|So, what's the good news?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002275|Except for what you gave me. And, those shards aren't enough to cover Chloe's tab.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002274|I don't have any shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002273|Okay then, the bad news.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002272|Let me guess, when you eat, you always save your favorite until last, am I right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002271|Aah. You are someone who takes what life throws at them then hopes for a rainbow round the corner are you, my friend?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002270|Interesting.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002269|Aah. An optimist. You are hoping that the bad news won't be as bad after you've heard the good news?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002268|The bad news.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002267|The good news.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002264|Just make sure the Duke gets his Elexit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002263|I don't care how you do it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002262|Her debts are now our debts and they will be paid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002261|Tell her to collect it, or do it for her.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002260|There must be a thousand people here in the Fort who owe her something.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002259|Chloe doesn't have the shards to pay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002258|Which do you want first?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002257|Well, my friend. I have some good and some bad news.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002256|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002255|And, she sent you to collect them?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002254|Chloe says you owe her Elexit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002253|So, if you can't get payment from Rat, you won't get it from me because I just...don't...have it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002252|I can't pay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002251|I've told William a thousand times.|Calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002250|But, you might manage it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002249|Not a chance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002248|Do you think I haven't tried?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002247|No, you get the shards from Rat yourself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002246|But, if you want Elexit, go to Rat. He has a huge tab open here. You can collect it. And then everyone will be happy? Okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002245|I have got enough of this I can give you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002244|Here. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002243|It's not just that I don't want to pay, it's that I don't have a shard to pay you. I have nothing at all right now.|Stress on nothing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002242|All a fight is going to get you is enemies.|With a shake of the head, calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002241|Give me the shards, or I will take them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002240|Do I look like I'm joking?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002239|Are you serious?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002238|Dammit. If you're really set on collecting something then go and see Rat. He owes me, so you can get my payment from him.|Annoyed, but thinking over her options
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002237|Is it a) No chance? b) Not a chance in hell?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002236|Or c) There's really not a chance in hell?|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002234|It was no guess, it's years of practice. Let's see if you can do the same. Guess what I'm thinking.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002233|Good guess, that's exactly what I'm here for.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002232|You're not here to collect the Duke's tribute are you...?|Realising the reason.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002231|What do you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002230|You'd better not have come here collect the Duke's tribute.|Realising the reason.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002229|So, why are you coming back to me now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002228|William sent you? 'I' sent you to him!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002227|Listen to what I have to say and then you go back to her.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002226|Well, then sometimes she is a good judge...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002225|Chloe told me you'd have work for me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002224|William sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002223|Go to William.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002222|If you want to earn something.|Honest advice, she likes to help people.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002221|But, I don't have the shards to cover more staff.|Resigned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002219|Well, we always need muscle.|Considering the player
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002218|Is there anything you need doing round here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002217|This one's on the house.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002216|Here. |

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002212|You're not the first.|Tired of the same old BS
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002211|Don't you think I'm capable of running this palace of pleasure?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002210|You sound surprised.|Controlling her anger
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002209|Bob doesn't like to be called Mad Bob.|A word to the wise.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002208|And, just a word to help you keep your head on your neck. |A word to the wise.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002207|So, he doesn't like anyone making trouble in his favorite place.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002206|But, he likes coming here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002205|Mad Bob doesn't work for anyone but himself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002204|Just call him Bob, if you don't want to end up bleeding into the desert sands.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002203|You will make him mad.|Amused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002202|You keep using that name.|Amused
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002201|Understood.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002200|So, you're in charge of this place?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002199|Why do people call him “Mad” Bob?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002198|Mad Bob works for you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002197|Just make sure you hand over your shards, or Mad Bob will be taking your hands. Clear?|Back to business

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002187|Any advice on how I should 'get a life'?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002186|Which category do you fall into, or are you just passing through?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002185|This is years of dealing with dicks, dorks, drug addicts and fucked up accidents waiting to happen.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002183|This isn't angry. This is mildly pissed at the inequalities of life.|Beginning to lose it.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002182|Angry?|Angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002181|All right, come on. Who are you and what do you want?|Back to business
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002180|Well, isn't that a rare thing?|Pleased

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002174|All right? Just like that?|Surprised
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002173|All right.|Calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002172|Can't you see I'm talking?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002171|What the fuck are you looking at?|Annoyed, seeing the player looking at her.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002170|I am so sick of having to deal with this sort of thing. Be straight with me and you'll get the same back.|To herself, winding down from the conversation.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002169|If you're here on business, talk to Chloe.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002168|If you're here for a drink, or chems, speak to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002167|No problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002166|Is there a problem?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002165|No problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002164|Show me what you have to offer.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002160|You know we can't afford shortfalls right now.|Making a point, the barman should know
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002159|Or, I'll send you to Mad Bob to have the equivalent cut out of you. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002158|If someone walks out without covering their bill again, I'll take it from your pay.|Shouting at the barman.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002157|Be sure that the Rat will not forget your small donation.|Gracious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002156|Friends, favors, they're what make Magalan go round. You get enough of them, they can make Magalan dance!|Positive, friendly
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002155|A good friend gave it to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002154|But, yes, you're right, I am not looking myself. Even this armor isn't mine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002153|I'm not begging, I'm requesting.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002152|You don't look like you should need to beg.|Assessing Rat
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002151|But...you have made your decision, and who am I to question it?|Reasonable
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002150|You should remember that. You can't get far without friends.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002149|Oh, rats never forget.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002148|And, this Rat will take you with him, to the stars!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002147|Rats never forget.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002146|Thanks, friend. I won't forget this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002145|Forget it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002144|Okay, take this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002143|So, how about those shards now then?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002142|Then this Rat will plug the holes and take the whole damn boat. And, then you'll really want this Rat as your friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002141|Doubly so in times like these because, oh, times are a changing and when the rats leave this sinking ship...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002140|And, in Tavar you need friends to help you up, to help you up, to stay alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002139|Because, sometimes friendship can be bought.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002138|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002137|Why should give you shards?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002136|Thank you, my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002135|Sure, here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002134|Do you have a few shards for me?|friendly request
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002133|Hey you!|Attracting attention
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002132|Let me know how things go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002131|Well, the Duke doesn't forget people who show him loyalty.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002130|Get things to move along more smoothly...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002129|I run things for the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002128|That is what I wanted to hear.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002127|I will look into the problems you're having.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002126|If you can get Mad Bob to start making deliveries again, I promise that will earn you a good reward..|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002125|But, maybe it's something else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002124|I am afraid he isn't delivering because nobody will work for him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002123|Speak to him and find out what's happening.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002122|The desert might be dry of water, but there's no way it is dry of scrap.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002121|Only now there isn't any scrap coming in and I don't know why.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002120|He oversees the scrap deliveries to the Fort. They're a big source of profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002118|So, prove yourself to me and you can swear loyalty to the Duke. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002117|Getting rid of Baxter meant getting rid of his men.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002116|But, yeah, we're looking for new people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002115|We don't take people from other Factions. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002113|Mad Bob... Yeaaah... That is its own chapter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002112|And, make sure that you teach Big Jim a lesson before I have to shut him up, permanently.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002111|You're to fight in the name of the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002110|Instead, I want you to fight him. He needs his ego deflating. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002109|I should want him dead...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002108|I always knew his ego would be his undoing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002107|I've even heard rumors he is claiming he will take over from the Duke.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002106|Only, now he's beaten everyone who's challenged him, he thinks he's invulnerable.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002105|Big Jim... good fighter, he's kept the Arena turning a profit.|Considering his answer
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002104|If you can't manage that, at least make sure she pays her outstanding debts.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002103|Ask her for the shards and find out why she's not been paying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002101|And, I need someone who isn't scared Chloe'll shut them out of the entertainment district.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002100|So, I need an outsider to make her pay up. It's a little more...diplomatic coming from someone from the outside.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002099|She knows she's lucky to have the position she has. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002097|Chloe owes her cut of the takings. That's not like her to skip paying her tribute.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002096|What is the problem with Mad Bob?|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002094|Tell me about Chloe.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002093|He calls himself the “Scrap Baron”. And, you'd better call him that. People don't call him Mad Bob to his face, ever.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002092|Then there's Mad Bob.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002091|Chloe, she manages the entertainment district.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002090|There's Big Jim, he's in charge of the Arena.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002089|Who are they?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002087|About these District Overseers...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002085|His rule is over.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002080|You'd better move on, we have to secure this area.|Official. Military
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002079|They thought wrong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002078|They thought they could take Edan from us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002077|Looks like these bastards were getting set to stay here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002076|Just in time too.|With hatred for the Albs
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002075|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002074|Did Hakon send you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002073|Those bastards deserve nothing but death.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002072|You think we should allow that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002071|When they build those monstrous Converters on our soil and fed our people to them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002070|When they came to steal our lands.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002069|They gave up their right to life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002067|Did you kill the Separatists here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002066|The only good Alb is a dead Alb.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002065|Is there anything else?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002061|Maybe then we can make the Free People listen.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002060|Once we are a large enough force -|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002059|We aren't the only ones to leave Xacor. There are more Separatists here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002058|You want payment?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002057|I didn't betray you. That has to be worth something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002056|What exactly are you planning?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002055|Good work, my friend.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002054|And, you can take these shards too. Get yourself something in the tavern.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002050|The Albs scouts you wanted dead, are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002049|Those few will save Magalan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002048|But, those few are everything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002046|Of all the ones we grow, very few make it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002045|With care and luck one of them might grow to maturity and become a World Heart.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002043|What exactly are you doing here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002042|Punishments too, so don't fuck about.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002041|Yeah.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002040|Outlaws, with rules?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002039|Got it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002037|It gets done. Got it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002036|I tell you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002035|The Duke tells me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002034|That means you do what I say.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002033|Logan is my cousin. That means I am his voice.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002030|So, you're not the boss here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002029|I need someone to deal with that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002028|Some of them are pissed about something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002027|I need someone who isn't on the radar when it comes to the District Overseers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002026|And, if you're not here for Calaan, that means you must be here for your own benefit - right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002025|The only true friend is profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002024|I don't care what Faction, or what god you believe in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002023|And, if you're not here on official business, that means you must be here for your own benefit - right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002022|The only true friend is profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002021|I don't care what Faction you believe in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002020|What do you mean outsider?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002019|What do you need my help for?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002018|You want a Cleric's help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002017|You want a Berserker's help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002016|And, I have one small crisis that I could use an outsider to solve.|Coming to a decision
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002015|This is about stopping all the little crises becoming big ones.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002014|Only an idiot thinks they have complete control of anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002013|Which means...you want to find ways to make a profit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002012|And, the Duke is my cousin. Which means you want me on your side.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002011|That makes the rules here pretty simple - You want the Duke on your side.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002010|Which makes you a lucky man, if you'd turned up here when Baxter was in charge you'd be dead already.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002009|The Duke runs this place and all of Tavar. He freed this place from Baxter's tyranny. He is just and he is profitable.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002008|You are new here. So, listen closely. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002007|Who's the Duke?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002006|Are you sure you have everything under control here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002005|But, they can forget getting them from here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002004|We are Outlaws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002003|And, I'm going to make sure he stays in charge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002001|The Duke is in charge round here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00002000|I am William. I am the Duke's cousin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001999|The Berserkers and their damned terraforming mushrooms, or whatever the fuck those things are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001998|Who wants your land?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001997|Didn't you know that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001996|The Clerics are short of new recruits.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001995|Who wants your men?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001993|One needs men and the other wants our land.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001992|They want to take us out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001991|They're both trying to squeeze us out of Tavar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001990|Berserker, Cleric, pfff.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001989|Not like those other Factions, they think everything's free.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001988|I hope so.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001987|I don't want anything for free. I'll earn it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001986|What do you have against Berserkers?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001985|You have problems with Clerics?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001984|They're almost as much trouble as the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001983|I hate those forest rats.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001982|You're just lucky you aren't a Berserker.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001981|... Another desert fly landing here think he's found something for free.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001980|You forest rats have caused me enough trouble already.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001979|... A Berserker in my Fort...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001978|Well, excellent...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001977|Everything in this fucking forest wants to kill you.|Sour
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001976|I just want to get out of this damn forest.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001975|I just want to live quiet, work hard and go home to Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001974|I just want to get back to work.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001973|What will you do now?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001972|I still can't believe it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001971|Reavers, not spirits...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001970|I'll give you a fair reward if you get it done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001969|You'll do that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001968|I'll kill the leader of the reavers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001967|Now, we stand a chance of finishing our exile alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001966|Thanks again for your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001965|But, maybe you can sell this to make some?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001964|I don't have any Elexit I can give you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001963|That really is a weight off our backs. I mean not an actual weight like we was carrying anything, but...whatever. Listen, um...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001962|You can be sure of that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001961|And, you're sure that the reavers won't come back? That they're gone for good?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001960|You really did it, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001959|The leader of the reavers is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001958|Just make sure you get rid them, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001957|And, make sure you get their leader, right? I've fought reavers before and nine times out of ten, they run if you kill their leader.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001956|We don't have much here, but I will give you everything I can if you take care of any reavers you find in the mine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001955|If there are more reavers there and they find out we killed one of their people then we will be in some real trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001954|Would you look around there for us?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001953|That would be the perfect hiding spot.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001951|The old mine. The Old World mine, from before the Fall.|Realising
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001950|Say, wait...A lot of the noises we've been hearing came up from the old mine.|Realising
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001948|Not how he was getting in here, or getting out? 'He' or 'they', I can't think this was all done by just one of them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001947|He came from the northeast.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001946|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001945|Did you see where this reaver came from?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001944|I'm going to kill Tomar, he swore it was spirits! He, said they were always round here. And, I went and believed him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001943|Fucking hell, a reaver? A person, a real person and not even a real Outlaw?|Annoyed with himself
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001942|I found him out there, it was a reaver. He's dead, so he won't cause you any more trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001941|No. No, it can't be.|In denial
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001940|Your spirit was a reaver not a ghost.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001939|Good luck. It was nice knowing you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001938|They come for them at night.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001937|Wait there if you want to, by our supplies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001936|You listen for the screaming.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001935|You don't look, you listen.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001934|Where could I look for these spirits?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001933|You are free to look for them if you are bored with life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001932|No, no one has. Anyone who sees them is taken. Probably killed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001931|Have you seen these spirits?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001930|The risk of getting taken by them is simply to great.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001927|They are plants we enrich with Mana.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001924|But, it happens.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001923|I know, I knew you'd think I was being stupid.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001922|That's why you shouldn't go outside at night.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001921|All the time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001920|People are disappearing here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001919|Spirits are taking your supplies?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001918|Well, it is better they take our supplies than us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001917|They've been taking our supplies too.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001916|They take people, animals.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001915|I know, I didn't believe either, but now I've heard them.|Realising he might sound stupid
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001914|The noises are...they're the spirits of the forest.|Reluctant admission
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001913|What strange noises?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001912|That is how you survive here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001911|And, if you have anyone to return to, make sure you keep your head down, that you don't go out at night and that you ignore all the strange noises.|Warning
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001910|I see now that what I did was wrong, and I will do my best to return to my family.|Heartfelt
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001909|And, we didn't end up in a cage.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001908|We weren't executed, or sent any deeper into the Valley.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001907|What do you mean by 'lucky'?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001906|To give us something to do.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001905|Why does Goliet get its timber from here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001904|Harvest wood here for a few moons, survive life in the forest, and we are allowed to return.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001903|And, we are the lucky ones. We have a chance here to clear our names.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001902|We are all exiles here. We all broke the Law in Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001901|Who are you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001900|You pick which of those you are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001899|The Valley of the Damned. Home of exiles, the condemned, the damned, the lost.|Reflecting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001898|No offense meant. Bastards.|If the player is an outlaw.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001897|Lying in wait, wanting to take what you have and leave you to die. They'll kill you for a single shard that's how much of a bunch of assholes they are!|Winding himself up.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001896|Stealing, lying, selfish bastards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001895|I've got nothing to hide but myself. You should take that as advice and keep a low profile while you're here.|Nervy
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001894|Like what? You sound like Angrim when he sentenced me out here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001893|Why so worried about who I am? Have you got something to hide?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001892|Didn't you see all the bodies? All those dead Berserkers?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001891|Didn't you come down here on that lift?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001890|Why shouldn't I have got here alive? What's so dangerous here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001889|Because...they're Outlaws!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001888|Why are you so worried about Outlaws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001887|But, what brings you out here, into the Valley of the Damned?|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001886|And you aren't an Outlaw. I was sure you were going to be an Outlaw.|Relieved
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001885|Oh, just my luck. The only person to make it through here alive is a bastard Outlaw.|Sour realisation.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001884|How did you get here alive? You're not an exile and you don't look like you've come to save me.|Surprised then considering the player character.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001458|But, you have to admit, that it's not usually a good sign if an Outlaw is hiding out and skulking around.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001457|You, for example, seem to be okay.|Backing away from his statement
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001456|Stealing, stealing of course. Bastards want nothing else but to make themselves rich. Not all Outlaws, most of them.|Going on his normal rant then realising the player character is an outlaw
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001435|I think Oran's death has done you a favor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001434|No wonder Eldur was angry. The Warlords will have to discuss this. We can't have division between the clans.|Understanding the problem
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001433|Yes, he had banned the Hammer clan from the tavern.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001432|Good luck in your next task. I'm glad no harm came to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001431|Well, we will have to find a way to manage until another solution is found.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001430|We pay dearly for our mistakes in difficult times.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001429|So, exile and the Valley claim another life...|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001428|Egil is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001427|Thank you for your service.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001426|Then the problems with the clans died with him.|option C
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001425|Damnation.|option B
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001424|The tavern keeper?|Checking
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001423|Oran is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001422|One death is bad, but if it has prevented conflict between the clans then his death has paid for itself. Eldur's kin will be informed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001421|Hmm, then the problem is ended.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001420|Eldur is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001419|She was fierce, but she was dedicated. She is a sore loss to us all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001418|Damn it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001417|Sinda is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001416|And, you seem to be the last person to see people just before they die. What are you, a serial killer?|option B Disgruntled.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001415|And, Argor was the last person to see Alvar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001414|What?|option A - shocked
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001413|Argor is dead.|if Argor is dead
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001412|I followed Alvar's trail to the tavern, but lost him there. But, without Oran I can't track him any further.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001411|Dead? Well. That's a shocker.|option A
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001410|Oran is dead.|if Oran is dead
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001404|Well, I'm out of ideas. Seems like I'm going to be stuck out here on my own then, doesn't it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001403|People are dropping like flies.|To himself, thinking through his options.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001402|By the Pilgrim, I'm starting to think this city is cursed.|both options lead into this To himself, thinking through his options.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001401|Maybe, he knows something about Alvar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001400|Argor's on duty at the Pit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001399|All right, I saw Alvar with Argor a few times. Fellow guards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001398|Let me think, let me think.|both options lead into this
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001397|What the fuck is going on in this town?|option B
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001396|He's about the only one talking to Alvar these days.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001393|Sure, you can do that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001391|Should I check the area around Ragnar's fortress then?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001390|My wife's still not speaking to me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001389|All I know is we caused some real trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001388|I've no idea where Alvar went.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001387|I woke up the next day under the balcony of Ragnar's stronghold.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001386|Last time I saw him we had a real session. He had some really hard stuff with him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001385|I'm afraid I haven't seen him for a few days.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001384|Has he skipped duty again?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001383|Alvar is needed on duty. Eldur sent me.|Conditional on the player having spoken to Eldur
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001382|Well, you won't find him here. So, be on your way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001381|I'm looking for a guard called Alvar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001380|You can stop there. Entry into the Pit is only for authorized personnel.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001376|You could ask his drinking buddy Argor, down at the Pit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001375|No, and I don't want to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001374|Do you know where Alvar could be?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001373|If you find him, you tell him not to show his face in here again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001372|I haven't seen Alvar since.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001371|Those two drank harder than I have seen anyone drink for a long time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001370|That asshole almost tore down half the tavern with his friend Argor a few days ago.|Growing angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001369|Oh, yeah, I know Alvar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001368|Do you know a Berserker named Alvar?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001367|And, thanks, yeah? At least you're trying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001366|Look, I know you're not Alvar's keeper, but please, if you find him send him here. I can't guard this sector alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001365|And, so you just thought you'd come back here to make me feel depressed, did you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001364|I can't find Alvar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001359|Right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001358|He could have seen Alvar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001357|Ask Oran, the tavern keeper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001356|Try the tavern.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001355|But, if you're going to start looking for him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001354|How should I know? He comes and goes as he pleases.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001353|Where is he? He should be standing guard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001352|What about him?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001351|About your friend Alvar...|This dialogue happens in the town, not after he's been
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001350|And, the humble thanks of the mighty warrior they left in charge of a whole sector.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001349|Take this Elexit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001348|Good to know some fly bitten wanderer I've never met before cares about me more than my own superiors.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001347|Thanks for taking care of that.|If the player didn't ask for a reward
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001346|At least you could stick to your word.|Stress on you, comparing him to Alvar
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001345|Take this Elexit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001344|Oh, and I said I'd give you some shards.|If the player doesn't know. Remembering, unenthusiastic
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001343|I'll have to risk it and go to Cormag myself. And, hope I don't get exiled for abandoning my post while I do.|Both lead into this
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001342|Me? I didn't even know where Alvar was. But, I hope someone finds that drug dealing, stretch of raptor gut and puts him out of our misery.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001341|Do you know who sold Alvar the chem?|iI he doesn't know
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001340|Listen, I think whatever strip of raptor gut was dealing that stuff deserves to die, but Alvar getting himself addicted? That's gone and landed me in it, hasn't it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001339|Then may he rot slowly and be forgotten. And may my superiors finally realize that means I'm stuck out here alone.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001337|So, you're not sympathetic then?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001336|Asshole. Couldn't even take chems right.|Frustrated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001335|He took a chem overdose.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001334|Well, I didn't. He managed it himself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001333|Excuse me, what? I asked you to bring him here, not kill him!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001332|He's dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001331|A pretty good one.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001330|Oh, great and what excuse did he have for not turning up?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001329|I found Alvar.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001327|Oran, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001326|Even if Alvar's not there, Oran might know where he is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001325|If Alvar's not on duty, there's a good chance he's sinking drinks in the tavern.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001324|All right, all right, you could try Oran.|Thinking and then getting an idea.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001323|Is anyone on duty today, or is just me defending this town?!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001322|Drog isn't at the city gate.|if he helped Katta
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001321|If anyone knows where Alvar is, it's Drog. Those two are best buddies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001320|He's probably on duty over at the town gate.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001319|You could start by asking Drog.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001318|I was hoping you'd say that.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001312|Just get me some back-up before those creatures get in here and turn us all into a feeding frenzy!|continues here
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001311|Look, care or not, do a guy a favor, yeah?|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001308|You are right.|option 4.2.1 humane -1 cold
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001307|Because, I'm the only guy holding back the whole of hostile Edan myself!|Angry. Talking fast

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001305|Because, you want to be safe.|Getting angry again.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001304|Why should I help you?|option 4.2
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001303|You couldn't go and find him could you? If I'm going to die, I might as well do it with company.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001302|Because that lazy, duty-skipping, strip of an assrag has disappeared.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001301|I'll find Alvar.|option 4.3
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001299|But, can you see him? No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001298|Alvar was supposed to be guarding the Seedling field.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001297|You know rotboars will eat anything? And I mean anything! I need some damned back up.|Getting himself wound up
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001296|Dead? Aw, great. That's perfect. Now, when their friends turn up, they're going to be really pissed.|Getting himself wound up
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001295|They're dead.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001291|You don't need to worry about those rotboars any more.|added if the jackals have been killed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001290|There is a guard at the entrance.|option 3.1
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001288|It's like they want this town to be overrun.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001287|Because, I can't think what I've done to be left here so I can have my man jewels gnawed off by a pack of mutant canines.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001286|Angry? Me? I've been ordered to stand here, balls swinging in the wind, with rotboars loose out there!|Angry, talking fast.

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001284|We recently captured some movement detectors from the Clerics, they're being stored in the Pit ready for the Elex to be taken out of them.|Informative
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001283|And clan second.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001282|I will. We must remember that we are all Berserkers first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001281|Let me know if you need my word added to yours.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001279|It is good you came to me with this.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001278|I will remind our dear friend that the Laws put our common cause ahead of clan business.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001277|When we have Albs pounding at our gate?|Angry
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001276|He wants to play politics at a time like this?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001275|Angrim was behind it. He hoped by instructing Oran not to serve anyone from the Hammer clan that he'd lure my people to join the Eisen clan.|Calm, describing the events.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001274|Have you spoken to Angrim?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001273|Well, I've investigated and it seems he was given just cause. He was set up.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001272|Yes, I'd heard.|Concerned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001271|One of my men was accused of causing trouble between the Hammer clan and the Eisen clan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001270|And your expression tells me this is something serious.|Concerned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001269|Ragnar, we have to talk.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001268|I'm just a tavern keeper.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001267|I think that's got nothing to do with me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001266|Well, I should have had more faith. It seems people do believe in our cause.|Pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001264|A little chat, hey? Well, however you managed it, it's a relief. I was worried this would build into something bigger.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001263|After a little chat, Oran agreed it was best for the clans to work together.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001262|So, Eldur can drown his sorrows instead of shouting them around Goliet? How did you manage that?|Pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001261|The trouble between Eldur and the Eisen clan is over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001260|And keep this matter between us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001259|Take this for payment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001258|Thank you for your service.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001257|We have enough trouble with the Albs without fighting amongst ourselves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001256|Then it seems I must speak with Ragnar and we'll find a way to persuade Angrim out of such tactics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001254|Oran told me himself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001253|You're sure of this?|Amazed, angered
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001251|Do as you think best.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001250|Angrim was behind the trouble. He hoped the Hammer clan wasn't being served that he could lure people to join the Eisen clan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001249|I'll speak to Angrim, all right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001248|Yeah, yeah. They'll get served.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001247|So, are you going to serve the Hammer clan again?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001246|Oh, you little shit. Tougher than you look, aren't you?|Defeated in battle, slightly breathless
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001245|I think Cormag should know about that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001244|I think he was hoping some of them would, you know, shift over to the Eisen clan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001243|He told me not to serve the Hammer clan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001241|What does Angrim have to do with it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001240|Just let me speak to Angrim, I'll get all this sorted out, yes?|Scared
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001239|Yes, yes, I'd be happy to. They're welcome here whenever.|Backing down
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001238|Are you going to serve the Hammer clan, or not?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001237|What's this to do with you? No reason for you to get all upset.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001235|Whoaaa, whooaa, calm down there.|Scared
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001234|Serve the Hammer clan, or I'll drown you in your own beer.|Aggressive - the hostile option.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001233|All right, all right you've got a point. But, I'll have to ask Angrim.|Relenting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001232|You want the Hammer clan to fight for you and you won't serve them a drink? Who's the enemy?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001231|Are you calling me an Alb?|Put out
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001230|If you fight amongst yourselves you've lost. You might as well join the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001227|You're all Berserkers.|Pacifying - the good option.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001226|You haven't had enough? As you will. Come here!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001225|Draw your weapon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001224|Do you really want to do this again? I've kicked your sorry ass already.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001223|Then draw your weapon and show me how seriously you want it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001222|So, you want me to start serving the Hammer clan again do you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001221|All right, hard man, let's see you outside, in front of the tavern.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001220|You think a tavern keeper doesn't get talk like that every day?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001219|Straight to the threats, hey?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001218|The Hammer clan will be welcome. I'll speak to Angrim and smooth this over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001217|Perhaps. I mean you have made a persuasive argument there. You see, problems can be sorted out like gentlemen.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001216|Maybe, this Elexit will change your mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001215|Serve them, or I'll kill you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001214|Am I? Strange, here was me thinking I decided who gets served. And, I don't hear any reasons why I should change my mind.|Calm
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001213|Then open it. You're going to serve the Hammer clan from now on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001212|Ah, that's a shame, bar's just closed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001211|The Hammer clan sent me...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001210|Here, take this. A small token of thanks from the Hammer clan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001209|I'll bet. But, however you did it, I'm thankful.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001208|Well, I'm very persuasive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001207|Well, aren't you the smooth skinned charmer, how did you get him to lift that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001206|Oran has lifted the ban on the Hammer clan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001205|You'd better watch yourself, there are jackals here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001204|And let the Hammer clan back in the tavern. That will sort everything out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001203|You get him to change his mind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001202|It's that self-important sack of assgrapes that has the problem, not me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001201|Well, someone needs to speak to Oran then.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001200|Cormag doesn't want conflict between the clans.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001199|What's all this got to do with you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001198|He's a member of the Eisen clan and is very picky about who he serves.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001197|A miserable streak of unpasteurized piss who works as the tavern keeper here in Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001196|You'd have to commune with the Pilgrim to answer that one, cos I don't know. One minute Oran will serve us, the next minute he won't even let us in the tavern.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001195|As far as I know and, selfish as it is, who cares if he's banned anyone else. I'm worried about my beer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001194|Has he only banned the Hammer clan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001193|Why won't Oran serve you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001192|Who is Oran?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001191|You want to do a ten day stretch of guard duty and then find you can't even get a beer at the end of it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001190|He won't serve me, or anyone else from the Hammer clan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001189|It's that self-important, pinchdick Oran who has the problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001188|It's not me with the problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001187|Do you have a problem with the Eisen clan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001186|What about it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001185|Eldur, I've heard you're causing trouble with the Eisen clan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001184|I will see what Angrim knows about this. If the Eisen clan are allowed into that tavern then the Hammer clan must be too.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001183|You seem to have a gift for getting people to talk. I want you to use that gift and find a way to persuade Oran to lift this ban.|Coming up with a plan
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001182|...is an empty flagon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001181|And, the only thing that starts men complaining faster than an empty stomach...|Immediately seeing the problem.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001180|Oran has barred the Hammer clan from the tavern.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001179|So, he told you why he was making trouble?|Hopeful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001178|I know why Eldur is angry.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001175|I'd be grateful if you can find out the reason he's upset, before this bad feeling escalates into something else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001174|You'll find him living with the other Cultivators, down in the Cultivator house.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001173|He's been speaking out against the Eisen clan, but I'm not sure of the reason behind his anger.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001172|You could do me a favor and talk to Eldur.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001171|Perhaps.|Weighing the player up
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001170|It seems I was wrong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001169|I had thought you were trying to fit in here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001166|Very well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001164|No. This is nothing to do with me.|plus one cold
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001163|Maybe they would listen to me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001162|But, it seems some people have stopped listening.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001161|I've been saying that over and over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001160|I say they need to be convinced that our cause is best served if we work together.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001159|You think we should use the Law to silence anyone who thinks differently?|option B
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001158|Not traitors. Troublemakers. People whose mouths move faster than their minds.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001153|Now, you sound like Angrim.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001152|Then shut them up.|option A
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001151|You have traitors here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001150|Anyone who forgets that needs a swift reminder of their true allegiance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001149|But, while there are always differences, we are all Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001148|Give any group a name and they'll use it as a cause for argument with others.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001145|Are there problems between the clans?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001144|How the flying set of syphilitic raptor bags is one man supposed to guard this area alone?!|When talking to him again
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001143|But, don't think which furry-arsed, pinchdick you're going to send to back him up.|Angry, talking fast.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001142|I need a piss, a sit down and a different fucking view.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001141|Oh, for the love of a...is no one going send me some relief?|Angry, talking fast.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001140|Shit. Shit. Shit, shit on a stick. 'Send Eldur on duty'. 'Put Eldur on duty'.|Angry, talking fast. Quoting his commander
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001139|No, I'm not your relief.|option 1.2
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001138|What back up?|Option 1.1
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001137|Are you my back up?|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001136|Hey!|Annoyed. Called - moderate projection, not yelled
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001135|Get out of here!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001134|What'll it be?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001133|Give me a drink.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001132|You'd better leave before your light fingers get you in trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001131|There's nothing here for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001130|Lock up your valuables, ladies and gentlemen. We have ourselves an Outlaw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001129|Get the fuck out of my tavern!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001128|That way I can tell you to go fuck yourself, right to your face. Go on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001127|Welcome, Cleric, always nice to see your kind here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001126|You want something to drink?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001125|So, you can get out Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001124|Machine-loving murderers with a god complex aren't welcome in here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001123|So, why don't you just fuck off, Outlaw?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001122|And a middle finger to everyone else.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001121|It is indeed. Tavern, home from home, resting place for the hard working man. We offer shelter to all loyal Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001120|Is this your tavern?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001119|Tell me, what brings you here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001118|You think I should report to you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001117|Welcome to the Berserkers! You want to make it all the way to the top you must observe our sacred traditions. Most sacred of all – never have an empty glass.|Welcoming. Pretending to be solemn. Back to welcoming.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001116|A new Berserker. How haven't we met before?|If the player has joined the Berserkers
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001115|An Cleric in Goliet. You certainly have courage.|If the player is a Cleric
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001114|An Outlaw in Goliet. You certainly have courage.|If the player is an Outlaw
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001113|What have we here?|Opening greeting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001112|The least I can do is offer you some Elexit as thanks for your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001111|But, we can't get by without those food supplies from the Valley.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001110|But, let's see them try fighting when they've not eaten for a week.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001109|These Warriors seem to think that fighting is the only thing that matters.|Getting annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001108|The same again for the second, so you get 500 Elexit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001107|There was 250 for the first.|Working it out.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001106|I guess they won't be claiming them now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001105|Well, the Eisen clan were due two payments.|Agreeing.

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001099|And, all the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001098|On behalf of Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001097|That's a fair request.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001096|Give me what you think is fair.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001095|Give me 100 shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001094|Give me 300 Elexit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001093|Oh, you don't know what a relief that is. I was going crazy here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001092|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001091|They will? You convinced Cormag to help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001090|The Hammer clan will get your supplies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001089|I will tell the men to be ready.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001088|Tell Sinda she can count on the support of the Hammer clan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001087|Excellent work. Now, my men stand a chance of seeing danger before they walk into it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001086|I have the movement detector you wanted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001085|I'm sure someone as resourceful as you can figure something out that avoids bloodshed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001084|That would be a safer and more acceptable route than harming the guard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001083|You'll have to scout it out to find the safest route.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001082|It's not for me to encourage the use of technology, but you could use those jump jets of yours to go over the wall and drop down into the gully from above.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001081|How do I get past the Pit guard?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001080|Get me that detector and I will help Sinda. Those are my terms.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001079|Sometimes, laws must be broken for problems to be fixed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001078|Admittedly, you could be more direct, but I'd appreciate it if you were discreet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001077|I've heard talk that you can enter the Pit from above, that could be your best way to avoid detection.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001076|That's a situation best avoided, don't you think?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001075|What if the guard catches me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001074|Isn't taking technology from the Pit against the Law?|Cautious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001072|Get me one of those movement detectors and I will give Sinda the help she wants.|Making a deal
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001071|I will send men to help Sinda, but if they're to go out there then I want to improve their odds of survival.|Coming to a decision
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001070|Still, if Angrim is worried about sending men then there must be a real danger.|Both 27 and 28 lead to this one. Thinking things through and seeing the issue.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001069|How does he think we'll eat if no one collects our food? Even his Warriors can't fight on an empty stomach!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001068|And, more will die if our men aren't fed.|Pointing out the obvious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001067|The men he sent are dead. They were attacked by a troll.|If the player has spoken to Angrim about the troll
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001066|Angrim is refusing to send more men.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001065|I thought Angrim had sent men to do that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001064|She needs people to collect the food deliveries.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001063|What can I do to help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001062|More trouble with the supplies?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001061|Sinda needs your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001060|He agreed to cover any problems that Angrim could not.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001059|If you can't persuade him then try Cormag.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001058|Then you should speak to Angrim, he guaranteed the supplies.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001057|The Eisen clan are refusing to help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001056|The Warlords discussed this and the Eisen clan promised to see to the deliveries.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001055|Further problems with the supply run?|With a sigh
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001054|Sinda sent me here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001053|Or, Cormag of the Hammer clan? I'll have to hope one of them can understand why this is important!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001052|Would you speak to Ragnar, Warlord of the Hooded Crows?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001051|He's in charge of the Eisen clan and the Eisen clan are in charge of escorting my supplies. But, you're right, maybe it's time to speak to one of the other clans.|Thinking it through, being persuaded
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001050|If the Eisen clan won't help, one of the others will have to.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001049|I'm a quartermaster, not a Warrior.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001048|Why don't you go yourself?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001047|Is Angrim the only person you can ask?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001046|Besides, it's not one delivery I need, it's regular supplies and a lot of them.|They need cartloads of supplies not what one person can carry.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001045|Well I appreciate the offer, but if his men were killed, I can't ask you to go alone.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001044|You?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001042|I could go for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001041|How does he expect me to get supplies if he can't? He's got a host of Warriors he can assign, I'm one person behind a counter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001040|And, is he going to send more? No, wait, let me guess, 'We don't have Warriors to spare chasing farmers'.|Asking a question then answering it herself, she knows Angrim of old.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001039|They won't. The men Angrim sent to the Valley are dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001038|Oh, great, thank you. Someone who is prepared to do something! When will the deliveries come?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001037|I spoke to Angrim.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001036|The Eisen clan will no longer risk lives for fish and meat.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001035|Tell her it is time she called on one of the other clans for help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001034|Sinda will have to deal with this problem herself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001033|I'll not send more men to their deaths, we have scant enough as it is.|both options lead to this one
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001032|Fight on too many fronts and you lose the war.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001031|Then send more people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001030|Good men. I'd fought beside some of them. Being eaten alive was not the fate they deserved.|Rueful – response to A troll
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001029|A troll killed your men?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001028|We haven't more men to lose that way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001027|The last group I sent were killed by a troll.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001026|Then, there won't be any more escorts for the deliveries.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001025|Jora was supposed to have sorted this out.|Both options lead to this one
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001024|What will happen with the food supplies?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001023|What does Jora have to do with this?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001022|Or, has his failure to fix things become my problem?|Realising he will have to deal with this.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001021|Didn't Jora sort this out?|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001020|She hasn't received the resupply she needs and nobody seems to know when she will.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001019|Sinda? Is there another problem with the food supplies?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001018|Sinda sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001016|My Hunters are doing their best.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001015|Thank you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001014|I will speak to Angrim for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001013|Move along there, move along.|Both options lead to this line – back to business

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001005|This area's restricted. No entry.|This starts a conversation
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001003|Can you tell Angrim that's how bad it is. That if we don't start getting boxes of supplies then the only thing he'll have to eat is boxes.|Calming herself
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001002|I need someone to persuade him how serious the situation is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001001|You? Well, I'm not one to turn down that sort of offer.|Surprised then grabbing the offer
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00001000|Of course I'm angry!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000999|Can I help?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000998|My only motive is to keep people fed. If I'm going to achieve that, I need someone to talk to Angrim.|Answer to any of the options above. In control.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000997|You're right, why should I care?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000996|Aren't you angry about that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000995|If we don't get that food, we'll be living on hope and fresh air. But, then why should you care if our Warlords don't?|Resigned
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000994|And, then failing to get them for me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000993|But, let's start with the Eisen clan promising me regular deliveries from the Valley of the Damned.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000991|Oh, I wish it was only one.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000990|It sounds like you have a problem.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000988|And then the two of us would lose out.|We = the player and Bigby
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000987|He might lose his motivation for coming out here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000986|Of course, don't tell him we have a deal when you meet him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000985|I don't think he'd argue with you over that.|Assessing the well armed player.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000984|He deserves to bleed a bit after all this waiting.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000983|I'll give you the shards I was going to give to Ornir.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000982|Why should I help you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000981|Carrying a piece like that openly on your arm could get you in trouble.|Refering to the player character's adjutor.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000979|It makes our warriors stronger, more powerful than any of the Albs' machines.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000978|What brings you to me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000977|You know you need to be here, but you don't yet know why if I'm not mistaken.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000973|Orik is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000972|Yes...Yes, there can be no true justice if the one responsible is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000971|I would have exiled him, but...what is done, is done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000970|Well... Then already he has received his just punishment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000969|He is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000968|Why not? What haven't you told me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000967|You are too late for that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000963|Come with me. I need someone to watch my back when I go look for some supplies. And, I know I can trust you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000961|Weren't you listening?|Optional bit, if he has told him about Ragnar before
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000960|He is the highest Warlord here in Goliet. Literally. He lives up there, in the ruins from the Old World.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000958|Ragnar the Fierce? Ragnar, son of Bjar?|Prompting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000957|How can you not have heard of him!?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000956|Who is Ragnar?|If the player hasn't heard about Ragnar before
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000955|We stand as guardians for fairness and justice. Equality and order. All who wish to join the Berserkers must answer to Ragnar.|Deep breath, reciting by rote.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000954|Our Warlord Ragnar, proven in battle, worthy defender of Goliet, leads us as we stand to defend our cause from all who would oppose it, from within, or without.|Reciting by rote. This is a well used and regularly recited litany.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000953|We are the Warrior clan of the Berserkers.|Proud
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000952|Who are the Hooded Crows?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000951|I can take pride from that. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000950|After all there were those who tried to stop using magic, they said it was against nature, now magic is all that defends it!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000949|You see, there is a Cultivator by the name of Orik, a willing and capable Berserker.|Getting to the point.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000948|We grow hope.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000947|And, that's what we really grow here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000946|But, only if they know their past and believe in a better future.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000945|Plant the right idea and they can become something amazing too.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000944|That's true of people too.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000943|If people hadn't remembered what is was like before, how could it have grown and bloomed again?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000942|This land around us was desolate only a few years ago.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000941|But, if we don't know where we came from, how can we know where we're going?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000940|I know, I know, what use is history when staying alive takes every scrap of effort we have?|Seeing the player 'doesn't...might not' know. Posing a question he's heard a lot before.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000939|You've seen what a wasteland the rest of the world is? Xacor's ice sheets, Ignadon's lava fields, only here in Edan can you can see Magalan as it was before the Comet hit.|Prompting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000938|What do you mean the jewel of Magalan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000926|The Hammer clan, the Eisen clan and the clan of the Hooded Crows? That's your Berserkers.|5
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000925|Clans?|4
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000924|I'm a good, honest, straight-talking Hooded Crow.|3
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000923|Cos, I'm a Hooded Crow. Not one of your rule making Eisen clan. Not a wannabe Hammer clan.|2
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000922|Why should I trust you?|1 Option 2.1
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000919|Preferably, before Caldrim notices it's gone walkabout.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000918|...to make sure it finds its way to a new home.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000917|Then it is my job, as a loyal Berserker...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000916|Not stolen, relocated.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000915|This Elex, is it stolen?|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000914|Want to buy some Elex?|Option 4.6
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000913|Still, no point worrying about that now. On to the next opportunity, hey?|Bouncing back
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000912|Oh, you blink and the magic is gone.|All negative cases come to this. With a sigh
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000911|You're too late asking me for that one.|In any other case.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000910|The Elex you wanted from the Mana shrine has already been taken.|If he gave it to somebody else
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000909|Caldrim already has the Elex from the Mana shrine.|If he gave it to Caldrim
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000907|Why so negative? With you talents and my brains we can achieve anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000906|I can't get you the Elex you want.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000905|All you have to do, is make it disappear from under Caldrim's nose.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000904|I'm telling you, Elex can make profits appear out of nowhere.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000903|Well, it just so happens that building contains all the Elex they use to make Mana and Mana is magic in whoever's hands hold it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000902|Big building in the middle of Goliet?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000901|You've noticed the Mana shrine, right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000899|Any more rare items you're interested in?|Option 4.5
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000898|You have been honest and achieved where others failed. You have my pledge, should you need it.|Neutral
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000897|Then I must send someone to do what you would not. He's not alive, not truly. You've sentenced him to a living death.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000896|No, he is still alive.|humane - 1 cold
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000895|Thank the Pilgrim. You see now why we wish to rid Magalan of Elex? That creature was a living demonstration of how it poisons us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000894|It is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000893|I hope you gave that poor creature a quick death.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000892|A brother's love. Kral must have thought he was saving Grimar, but to live as an abomination, twisted by Elex? Sometimes, love blinds us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000891|When his supplies ran out, he took Elex from the Mana shrine to keep his brother alive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000890|Since then Kral has been keeping his brother alive by feeding him Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000887|The mausoleum Kral talks of, that must be where he went. Maybe, Caldrim knows where it is.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000886|You've saved Grimar's life, thank you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000885|Maybe we can live there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000884|When Grimar gets better then we will make for Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000883|We will stay here for now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000882|Yeah, yeah, you're right.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000881|No, but you shouldn't return to Goliet again. Caldrim thinks this is over.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000880|You betrayed me!?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000879|I spoke to Caldrim.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000878|But, the main thing is that he won't be seen here again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000877|That is a shame.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000870|Kral managed to save Grimar, but, not before the Elex had changed him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000869|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000868|Grimar, his brother, was taken to the Converter.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000867|Did Kral tell you why he took the Elex?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000866|That is sad news. I feared his departure spelled his guilt. It seems justice has been done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000864|Correct.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000863|And, Kral is not here. Is he dead?|Concerned.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000862|I have recovered the Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000861|Thank you for your efforts. You achieved more than the guards did. One question at least, now has an answer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000860|I feared as much. No doubt it has already fallen into the wrong hands.|Disappointed.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000859|No, there was no Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000858|Did you find the Elex there with him?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000856|Then his crime has been paid for.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000855|He is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000854|Yes?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000853|About Kral...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000852|After my brother's cured.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000851|I hope I can I go back to Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000849|Maybe, I can explain that if I go back in the future. Say the body was mutilated, I'll say that I planted things on it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000848|They won't look for a dead man.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000847|Dead should answer the question.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000846|I'll say I found your corpse.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000845|What will you say to Caldrim?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000844|Yeah, great. I wouldn't have given it to you anyway.|Sullen
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000843|You can keep the Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000841|I'll find a way to buy some more.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000840|Here, take it.|Frustrated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000839|I can buy three times as much from the Outlaws for that price.|Protesting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000838|Are you serious?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000837|I'll buy the Elex off you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000836|Give me the Elex.|Using his suggestion skill
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000835|I'm weaning him off it, I'm sure.|Trying to believe
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000834|I'm controlling it. Trying to lessen the dose each time.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000833|You're feeding Elex to your brother?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000832|I can't give up on him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000831|I know he's still in there, somewhere. If we can keep him alive, I can get him back.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000830|He's my brother.|Appeal from the heart
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000828|He's my brother and sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing in saving him...|Sad, regretful

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000823|No.|

INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000814|Who says there's anything to explain?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000812|No, no I don't do I?|Dismayed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000809|Caldrim's not certain it's you and he doesn't know why you took it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000808|You can't. But if I don't go back to Goliet then they will know you're here. You don't have a choice.|Threat
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000807|I could lie to Caldrim.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000806|How can I be sure of that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000805|Tell me what happened. Maybe, I won't give you up.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000804|I've not seen you before.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000803|What's that to you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000801|No. Grimar still needs it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000799|Give me the Elex. Now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000795|Why did you steal the Elex?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000794|So, they have no other suspects?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000793|You know how much Elex sells for? Lots of people want to steal it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000792|Who says I did?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000791|You're the one who disappeared at the same time as it did. And, you're hiding out here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000790|You took the Elex from the Mana shrine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000789|I came to do a job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000788|And, you came running did you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000787|Yeah. You've come looking for me then, huh?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000786|Caldrim sent me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000784|Y-You should go, this place is dangerous. You, you should move on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000782|What are you doing here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000781|Tread carefully though, people are telling stories of some sort of undead creature there. Not that I believe in such things myself...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000779|It is a place for the dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000778|I don't know anyone who would go willing into that mausoleum to search for him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000777|Then he has picked the perfect place to hide.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000776|By the balcony of Ragnar's stronghold. Kral wrote about a mausoleum outside of Goliet. Maybe he went there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000774|The Mana potions we make give us that ability.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000773|Where did you find it? And does it tell you anything useful?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000772|Well, I found Kral's diary.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000771|Perhaps, we can live in this house of the dead.' Either this guy is reliving teenage poetry, or I just found out where he went. I should tell Caldrim.|Reading the diary.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000770|So, the choice is made and we must both go into the mausoleum.'|Reading the diary.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000769|If I don't act now then death must follow.'|Reading the diary.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000768|But, I have no choice. Surely to steal is better than to kill?'|Reading the diary.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000767|Last entry...'First the Elex devours him, now it devours me.'|Reading the diary.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000766|Kral's diary...No sign of the man, but let's see if he has left me a clue in here...|If the player is searching for Kral.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000765|Kral's diary. It is a clue to where he went. The mausoleum.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000764|Lots of written pages ... but I don't know what to do with them.|Suspicious. To self
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000763|A diary? The cover says it belongs to 'Kral'.|Observing the item. To self. Doesn't know of Kral or that quest.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000761|And that is yet to be proven.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000760|If, indeed, he is the thief.|Qualifying the statement
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000759|Or, he may have strayed further.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000758|So, he may have taken refuge in Ragnar's Stronghold.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000757|As a guard in the Hooded Crows, Kral has free access to all areas here in Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000756|Fine, I will find the Elex thief.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000755|But, thinking isn't certainty.|Cautious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000754|I think Kral is the thief.|Cautious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000753|I don't know, but Elex is food only for machines. Feed it to the plants and they become tainted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000752|What could the thief use it for?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000751|So, Kral stole the Elex?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000750|At the same time as Kral, one of our guards.|Letting the player connect the dots
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000749|Last week, five large pieces of Elex disappeared from the shrine before it could be transmuted.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000748|Elex corrupts people as it does the planet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000747|Yes, the biggest problem we have is temptation...|Sore about this subject
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000746|You say people aren't doing their tasks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000744|They bring the soil back to life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000743|World Hearts are the center of everything we do, the heart of the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000739|Very well.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000738|I have heard enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000737|World Hearts?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000733|It is Mana that allows us to do magic. No other faction of the Free People can do that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000732|Our Mana is everything. It is life itself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000730|What do you do with the Mana?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000729|Well, that is supposed to be what happens, but people don't seem able to stick to their tasks.|Back to business
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000726|So, the workers bring the Elex to us and we transmute it at the Mana shrine.|Quoting from Amrek's rules
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000725|From wasteland shall spring forest, for we are the healers of the world.'|Quoting from Amrek's rules
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000722|What do you do here, other than give free advice?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000720|Who would have thought that we would fight shoulder to shoulder as defectors?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000719|You took them on? On your own?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000718|I took care of the Albs that were hunting you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000717|And, as we know, true Albs follow protocol. They will still be at that position.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000716|Since they don't know our strength they'll follow protocol and wait there for reinforcements.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000715|Their last position was northwest of here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000714|Do you know where this special forces unit is?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000712|Our old comrades are out to kill us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000711|They outnumber us and they are better armed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000710|Parsek has sent a special forces unit to find us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000709|You're being hunted by Albs?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000708|You can't trust an Alb. Don't learn that the hard way.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000707|You know what we can do, persuade them they need us on their side. That we can help. We seek an alliance, not a fight.|Appealing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000706|Is there a Berserker you can trust? Someone who would work with us? If there is, please talk to them for us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000705|The Berserkers have enough to fear from Xacor without fighting us. We have to persuade them of that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000704|You had better leave Edan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000703|I could speak to the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000700|What happens when we have used all of the resources?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000699|But, what then? What happens when there is no more Elex?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000698|Well, we think that the Albs will win someday.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000697|There must be another way get Elex than to extract it from living people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000694|What do you think of the Free People?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000692|Then it seems we may have to fight to be recognized. Very well, so be it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000689|He can't see past the blood that was spilled?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000687|None. I lied and kept your offer from him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000686|And? What answer do you bring?|Tense
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000685|I spoke with the Berserker Hakon.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000683|It's no trap. They want your help. They're fighting the Albs to put an end to the bloodshed. To get rid of the Elexetors.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000682|If Hakon will offer us a haven here, the protection of a truce, we will fight against our common enemy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000681|We will find a way to pay reparation for what we did and we can start by offering a hand in alliance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000680|We have to convince him of that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000679|But, we are not who we once were. We are no longer Albs who blindly follow the word of the Elexetors.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000678|We killed Berserkers in the battle before we changed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000677|There's a truth in that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000676|Hakon says you killed his men.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000675|Hakon? What does he have to say?|Wary, knowning Hakon is an enemy.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000674|The Berserker Hakon sent me to speak to you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000673|But, unless we can find people, Free People who will work with us, then we don't stand a chance.|Back to reality
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000672|Hope that our freedom means something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000671|But, with that fear comes something else. Hope.|Thinking through the new emotions
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000670|Logic, precision, they are what we have been for most of our lives and now we find those things...challenged. It is confusing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000669|Yes, I know. Elex withdrawal is hard.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000668|Fear of what?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000666|And, we do it with fear. For the first time, we do it with fear.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000665|Hiding from the Albs, hiding from the Free People and wondering what will become of us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000664|What have you been doing here in Edan?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000661|In order to save the Albs, the Elexetors must resign and the Old Directive must be followed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000660|Escaping and joining the Separatists was the only logical course of action.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000657|I have heard enough.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000656|What happened?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000655|Eventually, our unit got round the enemy and returned to Xacor, but we had changed. We realized we wanted to think.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000654|Elexetor Parsek noticed it first. He sent out patrols to locate possible sources of Elex, but it was too late.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000653|We were part of an commando unit. Our mission hit problems and we were cut off from Xacor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000651|We didn't set out to become Separatists. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000647|And, where you've gone some of us are trying to follow.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000645|Strange isn't it? On this side, free from Elex and from control.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000644|But, just because you're free doesn't mean you're not a threat. Five minutes with the 'Free People' teaches you that emotions don't make people less dangerous.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000643|So, you've swapped sides too?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000619|Do you really think your lie wouldn't be discovered?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000618|Hey, you!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000617|Here. Take this as payment for your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000614|If they're lying they will pay with their lives.|Threatening
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000612|Get out of Goliet, before I decide you deserve worse than exile.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000607|They are...to the north, near the Converter.|Deciding to lie. Humane cold minus one
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000606|They are to the west. Where you said they would be.|Telling the truth plus one cold
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000604|Albs that want to fight Albs?|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000603|You're serious?|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000602|Allies? This stinks of a trap.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000599|And, you believed that shit?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000597|Separatists? What are you talking about?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000596|Those Albs didn't kill your men. They have left Xacor, they're free from the Alb Directive.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000595|They're Alb Separatists. They don't take orders from Xacor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000594|No, no, you're full of shit. Albs don't speak to anyone.|Accusational
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000593|to the Albs? And you're still alive?|Doubtful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000592|I spoke with them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000591|So, they are scouting those locations. They must be planning another attack... Did you kill the scouts, or are you here to ask for help?|This confirms his fears. Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000589|There, I think I've found those Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000588|No trace of the Albs here. Where are they?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000587|So...where are those Albs...?|Looking around, but unable to see Nezol and his men in the place he was told to look.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000586|It is a good thing you took care of those Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000585|You had better take care of those pale skins, or people will think you're a sympathizer.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000584|Where are these ruins?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000583|Or looking for somewhere to set up a base they can use to launch an attack on Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000581|The Albs have been scouting ruins to the west of here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000579|Where are these Albs?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000578|Typical outsider. You'll come here and take from us, but you won't fight to save what we have. Let's see if you think the same when those animals come here looking to kill you.|Scornful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000577|Very well.|Pleased
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000572|Now, I'm asked to make up my ranks with outsiders?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000571|Ten Hooded Crows, on the last patrol alone. All good men.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000570|It's always us Berserkers who are taking losses.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000569|And, do you see anyone else fighting them?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000568|So, the only way to stop them is kill every last damned one first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000567|They won't stop until everyone is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000564|The only thing stopping these bastards killing every last one of the Free People are the Hooded Crows.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000563|Kill our people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000562|They foul our soil.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000561|The Clerics gave us the Albs, the Albs come here building their filthy Convertors.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000558|But, if you want to be an Alb, you can die like an Alb.|Moving to attack the player character.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000557|You don't look like one of those jumped up Elex junkies.|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000556|What? You think you're an Alb?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000555|Xacor?|Taken aback
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000554|Are you going to take me back to Xacor yourself?|Confrontational
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000549|Another damned outsider.|Aggressive, in conversation camera
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000548|So, I'm here to collect it and put it to use.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000547|Trading would be illegal. Elex technology is forbidden. Trading without a license is forbidden. Trading with people outside Goliet is forbidden.|Still protesting, but starting to fold and give himself away. Talking quickly
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000546|Worthless to us, but to an Outlaw? They'd try and sell maggots to a corpse wouldn't they?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000545|And the Pit is where we throw all the bits of technology once they have had the Elex removed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000544|Stealing, stealing of course. Bastards want nothing else but to make themselves rich.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000543|No, no, I wouldn't want to put them in danger. But, you. You look like you can handle yourself.|Making an excuse
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000542|No, no. they're...if that's a real Outlaw, they couldn't deal with him. They're not top notch, that's why they're here not on the front line.|Making an excuse, he doesn't want his secret to be discovered.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000541|Why would an Outlaw be down there?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000540|Why don't you tell the guards?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000539|You're new here, right? You're an incomer?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000537|So, if you want something from him, you should see him soon before he leaves for the Valley.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000535|If he survives, then I will permit him to return to Goliet.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000534|He will be exiled to the Valley of the Damned for a year.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000533|As to your question. Yes, Ornir has received his sentence.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000532|Such service shouldn't go unrewarded.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000531|Thank you for your service. Continue on this path and you will rise through the ranks here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000529|So, it was you who reported him?|Assessing the player, positive, realising the player did the duty
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000528|Has Ornir been sentenced?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000527|Or worse. Right now they're hanging the sentence over my head, probation they said... if I put one foot wrong then I'll be thrown out of Goliet...You asshole...|Down, sullen
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000526|I'll probably end up in the Valley of the Damned because of you|Upset
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000524|You told Jora I was trading with an Outlaw didn't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000523|You asshole! You total asshole.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000522|This is down to you isn't it?|Upset, scared
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000521|Get out of here. We have nothing more to say.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000520|I will make sure Ornir is sent to him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000519|Oh, and please, inform Angrim of Ornir's transgression.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000518|Thanks, I will look into it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000517|Well, that makes Ornir a double-dealing traitorous, little shit, doesn't it? As if we didn't have enough trouble...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000515|Ornir is stealing technology from the Pit and selling it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000514|I didn't say we'd met, just that I recognized you, but...no, you couldn't be him.|Persuading himself the player character can't be who he thinks.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000513|You must be mistaken. We've not met.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000512|Come on, the truth now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000511|Then tell me what happened to him.|Warning
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000510|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000509|Did you kill him?|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000508|These Seedlings, they're our true hope.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000507|One more mature Seedling and I could solve this question, I know it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000506|At least that makes them weaker. Then they're easier to kill off. But, only after they've done the damage...|With a laugh in his voice
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000505|No, no, not now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000504|Just leave me alone, won't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000503|I'm waiting, I'm waiting. That little shit better show up.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000502|Shit...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000501|Now, all my gear is trapped in that shitty Pit of theirs and I don't know how to get my shit out of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000500|I've been stuck outside this goddamn, shitty city collecting shit for weeks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000499|Shit. Shit, shit, shit on a fucking stick.|Frustrated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000497|What? Are you serious?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000496|Ornir is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000494|Like I said, they throw all sorts of valuable shit into that Pit of theirs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000493|It's not like they were even using it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000492|I just took some shit, that's all.|Appealing
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000491|Not barred as such, more like 'forbidden entry on pain of death'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000490|You're barred from Goliet?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000489|Good, thanks. There's someone there all right. Please, get rid of him.|A little desperate
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000488|I'll check the area and see if someone's there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000487|You can tell him that I need the same terms as before. No, no, he'll have to make it more, all right? Because of the risk.|Nervous
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000486|Okay, I will trade with Bigby again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000485|You tell him that if you see him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000484|That shit better turn up.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000483|Here, take the shards I was going to pay him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000482|But, he won't come here and tell me that himself? Slimy, little raptor shit...He'd better make good, or I'll find him.|Irritated
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000481|Ornir will trade with you again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000480|Let's say you get Ornir to show up. Then, I'll give you what I would've paid him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000479|Okay, let's say you will.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000478|Just like that?|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000477|You'll speak to him?|Suspicious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000476|I'll speak to Ornir for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000475|He gives me that, I give him some shards. No one shoots anyone. We're all happy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000474|And, I know he's there. I've seen the little shit creeping round, peering out of the gate.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000473|Were all happy. That asshole has left me out here with nothing for the last week.|Annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000472|He finds the best shit in the Pit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000471|No, no, no. I've got an arrangement. With Ornir.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000470|The Berserkers get rid of the tech they don't want, Ornir gets shards he does want, leaving the question...what do you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000469|The shit. The technology Ornir owes me. The prime pieces from the Pit. Well, 'prime' is stretching the description, but, it's a good arrangement.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000467|What 'shit'?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000466|Tell him, tell Ornir, I want the shit he promised me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000465|Listen, you go to him and get that dickhead to start trading again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000464|So, you're just waiting down here, hoping someone brings it to you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000460|That little shit...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000458|What the fuck?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000456|I'm here to kill you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000454|So, who are you? The errand boy? What, he's got so rich trading with me he's got servants now?|Suspicious, annoyed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000452|He sent me to find you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000450|Maybe, might be. There's a chance I know a little shit by that name.|Edgy. Fed up with waiting.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000448|Are you waiting around for Ornir?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000447|But, while I know that, it's not like I can hang about up there in Goliet to try and get it. Those tree shaggers get funny about Outlaws. Sometimes, they bar you from the town for no reason.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000446|I'm trying to find some shit that's worth selling. Do you even know how much tech they have stashed in their Pit? That they actually throw all that shit away!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000445|What do you think I'm doing?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000444|I am waiting on your mom.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000443|What are you doing here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000442|And you came here to talk did you? You want me to talk? Well, how's this for talk? Go fuck yourself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000441|You're the one in trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000440|I'm on vacation. Look at the view. Stick around the dancing girls are on at eight.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000439|What are you doing here?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000438|Find you? I wasn't looking for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000437|So, what do you want?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000436|What? I can't stand here? You're going to hassle someone for just standing here? What are you a fucking Alb?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000435|Is that so?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000434|I don't want trouble.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000433|Why are you hanging around outside Goliet?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000429|Last thing I need is another Outlaw screwing up my business out here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000428|Back the fuck off, all right? You don't need trouble. Just walk away and pretend you didn't find me, okay?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000426|Shit...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000425|And, I'll tell them you were involved. If I go down, you will go down.|Nervous threat
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000424|But, I won't take a gamble of getting exiled. As soon as there is even a trace of a suspicion against me this is over.|Nervous
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000423|All right then... I will start trading with Bigby again.|Nervous. Making a decision
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000422|Well, if it matters that much to you.|Considering the shards. Weakening
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000421|You should keep trading with Bigby. Here, will this Elexit persuade you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000419|So, you can trade again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000418|No, no, it shouldn't be that much of a risk. I should keep trading.|Falling under the 'hypnosis'
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000417|There really isn't much risk of being caught. You haven't been so far, have you? You will keep trading.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000415|So, looking at it like that, the risk really isn't that great.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000414|How did I not think of that myself?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000413|That... That is great...|Thinking it through
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000412|Disguise the traces of Elex as Mana by overlapping the waves. This will mask it.|Making a suggestion
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000411|Aha? And how does that work?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000410|You could conceal the Elex fluctuations.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000409|Anyway, I mean. That stuff was junk, I wasn't doing any harm. And Angrim was monitoring the Elex oscillations in the area.|Seeing it's no use lying, glum
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000406|I wasn't trading!|Protesting
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000405|Why did you stop trading with him?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000404|What? What about him?|Jumpy
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000403|About the Outlaw...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000401|If I was trading, that would be against the Law, I mean, I'd be a dead man.|Obviously guilty.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000400|Trading? What trading? What, what are you talking about?|Obviously guilty.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000399|He wants you to start trading with him again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000398|Talked? Why did you talk? What did he say?|Scared of being found out
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000397|No, I talked to him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000396|Is he dead?|Nervous
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000395|I found the Outlaw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000394|Here, take this as thanks. Your work shouldn't be for nothing.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000393|Having that Outlaw hanging around Goliet wasn't good for anyone.|Covering up his real motive, edgy
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000392|So, well, that's...that's good. Thank you, from the Berserkers.|More guilty than relieved, he has had his problem killed
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000390|Yes, you don't need to worry about him anymore.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000389|You killed him?|Checking, wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000388|The Outlaw by the gates, he's dead.|Reporting the fact
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000385|I saw him by the cliff outside the gate into Goliet. You know, below the Pit? You should check around there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000383|Good, good, great, thanks.|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000382|I will take care of the Outlaw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000381|I'm certain he's up to something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000380|I'd recommend you do it from a distance. Don't get close.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000379|Kill him. The Outlaw.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000378|What exactly do you want me to do?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000377|Look, Angrim's already watching me. He hears I've been near an Outlaw, I'm dead, or exiled.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000376|I mean if he was a piece of technology, I'd be there, the Elex would be out. The Law would be satisfied, but...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000375|I'm a technical expert. Angrim wouldn't want me to endanger myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000374|I, well, I'm not allowed to leave here. I've got to...do things.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000373|So, why don't you take care of it?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000372|If it is really one, then he has to disappear.|Lying, he knows what the Outlaw Bigby is after
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000370|I think he's an Outlaw. I'm only guessing, but...I think he must be after the equipment we throw down there into the Pit.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000369|I believe that I saw someone. In the Pit. Then he escaped. He's...sort of hanging around outside town, down that path near the gate.|Edgy, nervous, something to hide
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000368|What help do you need?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000367|As an outsider, you aren't bound by our Laws, not as much as a true Berserker.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000366|So, well, I hope that you can help me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000365|You Clerics are enemies of the Outlaws, aren't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000364|As an Outlaw, you aren't as restricted in your behavior as us, I mean... You don't believe things are forbidden do you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000363|As a Berserker, duty requires that you help other Berserkers. Right?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000362|Listen, can I ask you a favor?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000361|And it is surprising to me that you don't know of our Laws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000360|So, I am not surprised at all that you don't think much of our Laws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000359|So, I'm surprised you know about our Laws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000358|Well... You are not one of us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000357|Yeah? Make sense?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000356|So, you should know the Laws|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000355|That's not exactly hard to understand.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000354|You're a Berserker, aren't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000353|Why are you asking me about Laws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000352|It is time you had an education.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000348|You don't know of our Laws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000346|What Laws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000345|Laws should be guidelines.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000344|Strict, otherwise why have them?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000343|Tell me, what do you think about our Laws? Do you think they should be strict? Or, just used as guidelines?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000340|That's why I know your intentions were pure even if they were misguided. But, now you must leave, Orik. And may the Valley give you the chance to learn the error of your actions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000339|Please, you of all people, Caldrim. Your ears are open.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000338|And, if Angrim were to hear you saying things like that, he would overrule me and you would die.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000337|Didn't Eisenfaust experiment? Amrek himself took chances...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000336|You will never return to Goliet. Your belongings will be shared amongst your clan. You must never go near a Seedling again.|Passing sentence
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000335|But, you have to learn from this.|Pleading
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000334|I will use my voice to have your sentence commuted. I will see that you are exiled not executed.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000331|You've chosen a path the Albs have already taken and it would destroy us all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000330|Orik, these experiments were forbidden for a reason.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000329|This isn't about me, this is about the future of all of us. If we can just try this, allow ourselves to experiment more, this could save us all!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000328|You have to speak to them, Caldrim! I know...I know this was wrong by the word of Law, but the Seedling has made me feel...stronger!|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000327|The Eisen clan felt they had no choice but to ask for a sentence of death. They would be here for you now, but I begged for the chance to speak to you first.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000326|Why didn't you come to me, Orik? Your intentions, your diligence are admirable, but you must have known you were breaking one of our strictest Laws.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000325|Certain facts have reached my ears, I know what you have been hiding.|Stern
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000324|Yes? Caldrim...why are you here?|Nervous
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000323|Orik!|Calling out
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000322|He did love those plants and, if he felt they weren't secure, he would have been behaving out of character.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000319|Then, I must talk to Angrim. By the Pilgrim, I think that must be what had upset him, the security of the Seedlings.|Sad, realising something.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000318|Orik was killed by mutants.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000317|What are you saying?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000316|Orik is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000315|Now, I must see that justice is done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000314|Well, I thank you for the information.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000313|Those idiots from the Hammer clan. How can they think that that was a good idea?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000312|Good. Good. Please, tell me everything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000311|And now, I will never know what was wrong with him.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000310|I had my suspicions that something was wrong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000309|Then I should have acted sooner.|Disappointed in himself
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000308|He is?|Upset, shocked.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000307|Yes, I have some information for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000306|No. I have nothing for you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000305|Did you find out what happened to him?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000304|About Orik...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000303|One more dose?|Doubtful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000302|One more dose, maybe two and I'll become something else. Something that can fight the Albs.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000301|I've got to wait to try again, but I'm telling you -|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000299|And the little ones, they don't change the Elex like the mature ones.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000298|The rest don't make it. That's why World Hearts are so rare, yeah?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000297|It was a...it was a 'mature' Seedling you see? You're lucky if you get one of those every six months, or so.|Hesitant - Knowing he's admitting a crime
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000296|What? What? No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000295|You can see that, can't you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000294|Yeah. . Yeah, I suppose, but don't you see? If I can get this to work, if we can do this then...then we'd all be stronger!|Nervous again.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000293|Do you have any of that juice for me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000292|Don't your laws forbid that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000291|So, so I extracted the juice from a Seedling and, and I drank it. And, I felt...I felt like I understood everything. Every-thing.|Nervous of the admission
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000290|And, and if it makes us stronger, like the Albs, then we'd stand more of a chance, we could take them on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000288|So, I thought- what if we did that with mana? I mean it's been purified by the plants, so it should be all right, yeah?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000287|The, the Elex, the normal Elex, that the Albs are after, that makes them stronger. That's why they're so scary.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000286|Well, I was thinking, about Mana and Seedlings and...and us, right?|Seeking the words to explain himself.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000285|Are you going to get to the point?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000284|It takes courage to be the first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000281|Any experiment... It's going to take someone to show the way. To blaze the trail. To be the first.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000251|You see, Orik has continued with his tasks. He is polite and helpful. But, there is...a distance. He isn't as open as he used to be.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000250|Well, that's the issue. Suspicion is all I have.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000249|Yes. Well, perhaps it was too forward to ask for help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000248|I will just have to try and discover the truth myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000247|Sort your own problems out.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000246|I would like you to speak to him and see if you can find out what is troubling him.|Concerned.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000245|But there has been a change in him of late. Something... I can't quite put my finger on.|Concerned.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000244|What do you suspect Orik's problem is?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000243|His death is a real loss for our community.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000241|A tragedy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000240|But, I suppose now I will never learn what his problem was.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000239|I knew there was something wrong with him.|Upset, regretful
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000238|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000237|Orik is dead? You are sure?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000235|Orik is dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000231|So, that is why I'd like you to do the asking.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000230|Suspicion sticks and people can start to see someone as guilty even if there is nothing wrong.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000229|You see I need some answers, but if I start asking questions it might be as bad as me outright condemning the man in question.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000228|I need some less conspicuous than myself to do some 'enquiring'.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000224|It is your choice of course, but I would make it worth your while.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000220|Something has occurred to me. Perhaps you could help me with something.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000218|As the Elex passes through, it is changed, purified into Mana. If you bring anything that has been altered by Elex close to the shrine and you can feel it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000217|We place the Elex in the Mana Shrine. There is something in this mountain, the way the rock was changed by the Comet...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000210|Whatever words and interpretations have been added to Amrek's words, it is Magalan's future that counts above all.|too many people strictly interpret the words of the law.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000209|But, what matters is the spirit of the Law. 'Protect Magalan.' That is what Amrek truly intended when he founded the Berserkers. |
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000208|The Laws were laid down by Amrek when he founded the Berserkers.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000207|But, everyone else will look to your actions.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000206|Now, Angrim, or Ragnar will happily chew your ear about the Law.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000205|That is good.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000204|What are the Laws?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000203|I want to leave my past behind.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000202|If you are prepared to leave your past behind you should be given a chance. Are you willing to do this?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000201|It is central to our beliefs, and to me, that we should give all those who want it a second chance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000200|But, though it is not one of our written laws...|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000199|Still, you are wise to be wary. There are those here who would kill you if they learned your background.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000197|You're comfortable with an Alb living in Goliet?|Wary
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000195|But, you know, you do look really like him. You should be careful. If someone else recognizes you, er, thinks they recognize you. Then you'd never get back to the Ice Palace, hah.|Warning then cracking a joke.
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000194|That'd be crazy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000193|I mean what would an Alb Commander be doing here in Goliet? I mean, what? You just decided to stop conquering Magalan and hang out here with me instead?|Laughing it off
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000192|You, you look familiar to me. Yeah, I've seen you somewhere before.|Recognising the player character, hardly believing it
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000191|Wait a moment...|With an edge of recognition
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000182|A disturbance, a change to your life? And now events have brought you here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000180|Was it a strange sequence of events that brought you to Goliet?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000179|But Magalan does not suffer from temptation. You must feel the lure of Elex to your bones?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000178|Please, understand, whatever feelings are new to you, every person faces that same struggle.|Reassuring
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000177|Now, you - now, we will find out who you are.|Reassuring
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000176|Without that poison, you are free to make your own choices. You have told me who you were.|Intrigued
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000175|Then you are an Alb no more. It is Elex that turns a man into an Alb.|Intrigued
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000174|I was an Alb. But, I'm free from Elex now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000173|What are you talking about?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000171|You've not said what you're doing here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000170|Tell me, who are you?|Curious
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000169|The power of Elex...|Ready to talk about the shrine, but sensing something
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000151|But, it will take time to train Orik's replacement and give them the care they need.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000150|They don't seem to have suffered.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000149|How are the Seedlings?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000145|Watch out for the damn mutants. You're never safe from them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000138|It's like a drug, they need. If they don't get it, they die. They'd rather go without food than Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000137|But, Mana is made from Elex, right? The Mutants can feel that. They think if they eat the plants they'll get the Elex. But, they get Mana instead.|Reverential explanation
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000136|Of course. We feed them with it.|Calming a little
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000135|That doesn't help me keep the Seedlings alive though. And, that's my task, I look after all the Seedlings here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000134|Mutants eat Elex?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000133|There's Mana in the Seedlings?|
INFO_WEIDMANNX6_00000132|All that work, ruined by damned rotboars.|Wound up after the fight, venting.

INFO_DIRKSI5_00000290|So, I snuck in at night and pumped radioactive gas into the pipe.|
INFO_DIRKSI5_00000289|Well, I did some looking around and I found an access tunnel. It runs right into the command section of the Converter.|

INFO_IKENI7_00012108|But aren't you interested in what's going on out there? How Calaan's will can done?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012107|To be honest, I wasn't really listening.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012106|What did you think of the last sermon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012105|Yeah, yeah. If you say so.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012104|There's nothing shards and hard work can't solve if you really want to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012103|Well, there's not always an easy answer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012102|Don't tell me you're backing them up?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012101|Well, it is hard to get parts out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012100|Parts, repair skills, blah, blah, you never get the same answer from them twice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012099|Ask the technicians.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012098|Then why are still working with that piece of crap?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012097|The B-series was never very reliable, you know that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012096|Am I crazy, or is our generator power fluctuating?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012095|Well then, follow me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012094|Yeah, sure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012093|Yeah, well, maybe I've got luck and skill, but what I haven't got, is beer. Feel like one?|Admitting it
INFO_IKENI7_00012092|You were lucky. |
INFO_IKENI7_00012091|That wasn't luck, that was pure skill.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012090|You got lucky.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012089|Yeah, those idiots had no idea I was in there. I waited till they were busy with the next one, slipped out and I was gone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012088|You escaped in a crate?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00012087|Goliet? No. I was exiled to the valley before I came here, but I hid myself in a crate and got brought up in the lift.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012086|So, you come here from Goliet?|Observing the state of him
INFO_IKENI7_00012085|Fuck, I have been feeling a bit weird, oh man, that's the last thing I need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012084|Well, then get ready to hit the porcelain. If you've got the same thing I've had, you're going to pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012083|Damn, I ate some of that too!|
INFO_IKENI7_00012082|That slop Chloe serves in her place. It tied me knots.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012081|How come?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012080|Aw, I was stuck on the pot for three hours last night.|Pained
INFO_IKENI7_00012079|Yeah , yeah, all right forget it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012078|Hey, how about you give it a go. Just leave me your shards so I can pay for the funeral.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012077|All right, all right I get it. But, don't you think you should give it a shot?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012076|Yeah, that's why I'm so rich, respected and feared here.|Heavy sarcasm
INFO_IKENI7_00012075|Fuck off...what really? Before Big Jim was?|Taken in by the lie, surprised.
INFO_IKENI7_00012074|Yeah, I was champion.|Taking the mick
INFO_IKENI7_00012073|Have you ever been in the Cage?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012072|Right...I really thought it might be something useful. I mean it's on plastic, made to last. Why just do that to put your name on your chest?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012071|Who knows, but it's trash. Just get rid of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012070|What? Couldn't they remember?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012069|They used to wear these things so every one would know who they were talking to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012068|A... name tag? What is that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012067|A code? That's a name tag.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012066|Crazy, huh? You think it's a code or something?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012065|Hmm... I don't know, I see a Q, a U and a Y.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012064|Here, here take a look. What do you think is written on here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012063|I don't know, do I?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012062|Do you want to know what I found in the trash in those ruins?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012060|I know you, that won't be a problem...|
INFO_IKENI7_00012059|Yes, yes, we don't have much time...|
INFO_IKENI7_00012058|Well, come on, get those pants down... |
INFO_IKENI7_00012057|Well, what have we here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012055|You're the one who's dead!|
INFO_IKENI7_00012054|Well, if you really want to die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012053|Beer and women. That's all a man needs in life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012052|Please, can you help me? Someone has to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012051|If he doesn't kill me I'll starve to death as I can't do any business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012050|Well good for you. He keeps coming back for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012049|I fought him, I beat him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012048|Good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012047|Okay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012046|And, it's my job to give everyone this warning, okay? So now you know, follow the advice, all right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012045|I don't expect any more or less from you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012043|I'm telling you that because you somehow managed to get in here without talking to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012042|Oh, and don't steal anything, or flash technology around.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012041|Right, got it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012039|Look inside yourself and take my words to heart. May they be a guide in the times to come.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012037|The path to enlightenment is difficult, and only those who are worthy will receive Calaan's blessing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012036|You had better listen to what I am telling you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012035|There we will truly see the universe as it is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012034|To where knowledge counts above all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012033|Ignorance shouts loudly in the face of knowledge.|Sanctimonius
INFO_IKENI7_00012032|Up to the Infinite Skies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012031|Where is Calaan supposed to take you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012030|You really believe this Troll piss?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012028|But, who ever listens to me?|#N/A
INFO_IKENI7_00012027|Some days I wish another comet would come and just wipe this whole planet out.|#N/A
INFO_IKENI7_00012026|I can't beg those shards from people. No one'll give me anything like that much.|#N/A
INFO_IKENI7_00012025|Wouldn't make any difference if you didn't, I still couldn't get you enough shards.|#N/A
INFO_IKENI7_00012024|I understand.|#N/A
INFO_IKENI7_00012023|How you get my shards is your problem.|#N/A
INFO_IKENI7_00012021|How am I supposed to get the shards to survive now?|#N/A
INFO_IKENI7_00012020|Next time you had better come right to me, the rest can wait. Got it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012019|What? Well, you could've planned that better.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012018|That's all the rations I have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012017|This is his favorite stuff, he'll go for it for sure. And, he won't know what's hit him. |
INFO_IKENI7_00012016|The lift should function again soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012015|The poor bastard dragged himself here with his last strength and then succumbed to his injuries.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012014|Ah, very good. Then take care of your duties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012013|I already have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012012|He was exiled there, but I need someone of his ability.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012011|Max? He hasn't been seen in a long time. I'd assumed he was dead already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012010|So, good luck out there, my friend. May Calaan watch over you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012009|I won't be here the next time you enter the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012008|All there is left to do is to wish you good luck.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012007|Come on then, you bastard!|
INFO_IKENI7_00012006|Try it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012005|I will kill you, you fucking asshole!|
INFO_IKENI7_00012004|We have to plant them in places like this, because it's where they make a difference. This, all this around us, is because of the World Heart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012003|Sure, I could stand at the gate and wait to get eaten, but here I am someone! Everyone knows Ike! Fears Ike! I am the man!|Trying to persuade himself
INFO_IKENI7_00012002|What? Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah.|
INFO_IKENI7_00012001|Well, then? Are you going?|
INFO_IKENI7_00012000|Yeah, man. Why not. Hey, I'm finished here, so, well yeah. I might as well earn some shards. Yeah. Yeah...yeah.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011999|Now, are you going to do guard duty at the North Gate?|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00011998|Until then, buddy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011997|A regular set of shards doesn't sound bad, after all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011996|Yeah, yeah. Why not?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011995|The Arena's where I belong. Say, why don't you do it? It seems you like kissing William's ass.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00011994|Guard duty? What? Noooooo. I'm the man, the man! I am the Arena king.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011993|So, will you do it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011992|Well, if that's the case...|
INFO_IKENI7_00011991|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011990|Ah, what? He does?|Taken aback
INFO_IKENI7_00011989|William wants you to stand guard at the North Gate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011988|Here, thank you, for taking care of that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011987|Good, hopefully he'll do a better job than his predecessor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011986|Ike has taken over as guard at the gate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011985|Thanks a lot for the news.|Sarcastic
INFO_IKENI7_00011984|Well, someone else can find a replacement.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011983|I'm stuck here trying to do the job with a thousand incompetents running round creating problems every day.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011982|Fuck the guards, fuck them all!|Growing angry
INFO_IKENI7_00011981|I have to pay for all these people that are dropping dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011980|I'm starting to lose my patience here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011979|Because, he's dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011978|Why not?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011977|Ike can't take over as guard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011976|Ike, for Spike? You're too late, Ike's dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011975|He's normally somewhere around the Arena. It shouldn't be difficult to find him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011974|Look for Ike and tell him he has Spike's job.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011973|We had better find a replacement quickly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011972|That ass was always too greedy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011971|And, I can imagine why.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011970|I knew his greed would mean his neck at some point...|
INFO_IKENI7_00011969|Spike tried to con the wrong person.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011968|Spike is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011967|Why, what happened?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011966|You need a new guard at the North Gate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011965|There comes armor and weapons. So, earn your way and take the profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011964|There comes trust.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011963|But, to each who proves themselves, there comes profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011962|If you want to become an Enforcer, you will have to learn that privilege.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011961|Then you will start as a Runner, like everyone else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011960|Let's assume I join you...What happens then?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011959|You are not a Cleric and you will never be one. You forfeited your right to be one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011958|And, you friend, will not get anything from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011957|Only those who have acquired that rank can get that reward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011956|And, sure, it would be great if every Acolyte could get the armor we make for Paladins, but my supplies are limited.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011955|And, I have to look after my stocks. We're low on resources here, can't go wasting them on thieves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011954|I have my reasons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011953|You won't reoffend after you've spoken to them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011952|Of course, their methods are more effective than anything else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011951|You'll send me to the Suggestors?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011950|Why do you assume everyone wants to steal from you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011949|Join us here and you can start earning this armor, if you're good enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011948|If you want that, you'll have to kiss a lot of asses.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00011947|There aren't many who get to wear the armor of an Enforcer, or a Captain.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011946|Prove you can be loyal to the Duke. Earn profit and you'll get chance to buy anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011945|You get what you deserve.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011944|What will you sell me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011943|Get your equipment from your own people and quit bothering me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011942|Yeah, I bet you do, looking at the crap you're wearing. But, you won't get anything here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011940|Then you're in the right place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011939|I want some better armor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011938|And, the more hands we have working in Goliet the more chance I have of getting the help I need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011937|A good few shards for sure. But, if you've worked your way up through the ranks to be eligible, you should have earned a lot on the way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011936|How much?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011935|And, even if you're a Berserker of the right rank, he will make sure it costs you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011934|But, he'll only sell to Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011933|I'm sure there are some who don't notice how hard it is for everyone at the bottom of the pile.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011932|That depends who you ask.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011931|Are things really that bad in Goliet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011928|You can only get that sort of thing from our blacksmith.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011927|I can't help you there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011926|I need better weapons and armor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011923|So, if you want a set of it. You'll have to work to earn it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011922|A Cultivator isn't allowed to wear the armor of a Paladin. That armor goes with that rank and that honor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011921|I am only authorized to hand out equipment to anyone who has earned it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011919|Can I get some of this armor?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011918|But, a Warrior's armor must be robust, better able to absorb damage during combat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011917|So, for Cultivator armor, I make sure to give you the freedom of movement needed for working in the fields.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011914|As a Cultivator, you will be confronted with different challenges to a Warrior, or a Paladin.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011913|And as you go up through the ranks, you're eligible for different equipment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011912|Quality, skill, years of practiced technique.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011911|What's so good about the armor you supply?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011910|This is for Berserkers only.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011909|And, don't think you can go picking up any of the armor here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011908|My damned hard work. So, don't get in my way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011907|Well, you wouldn't be the only one, but let me tell you, it's not true. Damned hard work makes it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011906|You think the armor in this place makes itself?|Rhetorical
INFO_IKENI7_00011905|Come on, if you've got a question, let's have it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011904|You're a guest here, remember that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011903|That goes double for someone who decided to join your faction.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011901|You'll find them at the waterfall.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011899|So, as you see, science and religion do not have to be mutually exclusive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011898|It has given us the technology we need to be ready for the next challenge we face.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011897|It has given us the machines that allow our way of life to continue.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011896|The gathering of Old World knowledge and the order to further it was his greatest gift to all who have followed him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011895|Arvid himself left behind this knowledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011894|Where did you get your technological knowledge?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011893|Because, when the next catastrophe strikes our world only those who have been prepared will survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011892|That we must work together and gather all the knowledge we can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011889|Calaan teaches us that the Comet's fires will not be the only challenge we face in our quest for survival.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011888|If we are to save the people of this world we must teach them Calaan's ways.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011886|A place of true enlightenment and salvation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011885|Infinite Skies?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011884|To Calaan, knowledge and wisdom are sacred. It is through knowledge and understanding that we can find our way to the Infinite Skies and a true understanding of ourselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011881|What would you like to know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011880|He laid down the foundations for the Clerics out of the ashes of the old civilization. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011879|Through the prophet Arvid, he warned us of the Comet and the downfall of our world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011878|Calaan, is wise, but mysterious. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011877|Tell me more about the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011876|You can find your true purpose amongst our ranks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011875|You can be part of that future. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011874|The Prophet Arvid helped preserve the knowledge of the past and set us on a course to use it to build a future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011873|Because, we can show you the path to salvation. For yourself and for all of Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011872|Why should I join you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011871|And an oath was sworn to the Council by my forefathers. That makes it my duty to see that oath is kept.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011870|The Clerics swore to a code and that includes keeping our oaths.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011869|Even if you don't care about the blood spilled since the Council's rule was broken.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011868|Laws for prisoner exchange, that assured borders, set rules for trade?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011865|You don't think that was a better time?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011863|Listen, the Council has gone, why care about what they said?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011862|I'm not that well informed on my history.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011861|The Great Council, yes. You'll have to speak to Judicator Alois if you want to know more about that. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011860|You mentioned the Council of Magalan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011859|Their attacks mostly consisted of small raids, but it was only a matter of time before they tried something bigger.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011858|They were violating the resolutions almost as soon as the Council had made them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011857|Because they aren't worth my breath.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011856|You left the Outlaws out of your story.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011855|We haven't recovered from that defeat, even today.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011854|Then Berserkers' magic grew stronger until one battle where our machines failed. Whole squadrons of our troops were wiped out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011853|We were arrogant, we assumed the technology we'd stockpiled, the weapons we'd developed would be enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011852|The Hort assumed the war would be short. Back then we didn't know the power their Mana can unleash.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011851|And, there's been war ever since?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011850|When we weren't able to reach an agreement, weapons began to speak instead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011849|They needed it for their Mana, we needed it to drive our machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011847|In those days, the Clerics were fighting the Berserkers over an Elex deposit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011846|Because, as a species, we are actually pretty, damn dumb. and I'm not excluding the Clerics here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011845|Why doesn't anyone keep to the Pact now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011844|We have to free our man.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011843|Good, let me know when you are planning to head to the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011842|I have heard enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011841|But, during that time each group was increasing, growing in size, becoming more committed to their cause. It just made the next war all the bigger.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011840|You know peace reigned for almost forty years?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011838|There was constant warfare that threatened to destroy us all. It was the Clerics who brought all the factions together to sign a non-aggression pact to save us all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011837|Yes, that was almost one hundred years ago.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011836|The great Council of Magalan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011835|So, they will have you thrown out if you manage to get into the Archives without authorization.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011834|So, the archivists don't like it at all when people interrupt their work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011833|Our archivists are attempting to glean all sorts of information from the scraps of data we were able to retrieve from outside the Hort. The work is very time intensive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011832|It's a store of knowledge from before the Comet hit. And it is where all information found in the rest of the world is brought.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011830|What can you tell me about the Archives?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011829|Good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011828|I think I've heard enough about that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011827|You have not been chosen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011826|Because, only those chosen to study his writings may do so.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011825|Why not?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011824|You? No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011823|As I said, only a few of us can truly understand his words and so see the wisdom of Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011822|Some of it is in code, some of it is written as parables, so is open to interpretation. It is for those who concentrate on study to reveal these mysteries to us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011821|Calaan only takes those who are pure. And, so to preach his words, we must be the purest of all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011820|Encrypted? In what way?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011819|The greatest portion of Arvid's knowledge is encrypted. Even today, we are struggling to understand it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011818|His prophecies and principles of life, around which we guide our lives.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011817|What is in the book?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011816|Can I read Arvid's teachings?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011815|Of course. All of Arvid's wisdom that remains is stored here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011814|Is there a copy of Arvid's teachings in the Archive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011813|You must seek elsewhere for more answers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011812|I had better return to my duties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011810|Calaan teaches that knowledge comes at a price. And, it is those who dedicate themselves to the recovery of these artefacts that pay the highest price.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011809|But, even so, there are expeditions that don't go perfectly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011808|There's a lot of planning involved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011807|Those areas tend to be infested with mutants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011806|Trust me, you wouldn't want to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011805|You can't. We have specialists for that work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011804|How can I get on a reclamation squad?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011803|We send out reclamation squads to search Old World ruins.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011802|It takes persistence and luck. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011801|As soon as that is done, we begin salvaging the valuable pieces and bringing them here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011800|First the selected area has to be pacified.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011799|Another thing about the Archives...|
INFO_IKENI7_00011798|Where do you get the material to study?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011797|Who knows what corrupting influence these artifacts could have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011796|That is one of the reasons why we only task those with the strongest wills to study.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011794|Of course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011793|If we repeat the mistakes of our ancestors it could lead to another catastrophe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011791|Do you also study the Old World?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011790|They live in the moment, we have committed ourselves to the future. May Calaan open the Infinite Skies for us all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011789|The Berserkers and the Outlaws will never have the discipline for that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011788|To achieve purity of soul we must understand ourselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011787|And, science is the purest of all the forms of study. It brings clarity to the mind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011786|And, knowledge, facts, interpretation and analysis are the purest form of all devotion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011785|It means passing Calaan's tests.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011784|What does that mean?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011783|Everything that brings us closer to our goal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011782|What are you studying?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011781|So, tell me. Why do you think I would let you into the Archives?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011780|Is that clear?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011779|The only people allowed into the Archives are those who have authorization, or who have reached at least the rank of Acolyte.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011778|Some specialists are given their workshops, their fighting mechs, this is a place dedicated to learning.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011777|Because, what we store here is precious, as is the space to study.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011775|Why aren't the Archives open to everyone?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011774|Yes, it's one option. But, we need a plan B.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011773|The ransom money you have is an option!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011769|I see your meager means are punishment enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011767|What sane person wants a war. But, as we've got one, so it's come down to who wins it. And, I want our leaders to be the ones who rebuild this world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011766|So you don't want the war?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011765|And yet, here are the factions at war with each other instead of clearing the wreckage of the Old World to build the new.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011764|A lot of people say that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011763|So, we must plan too. Plan and train.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011762|And while we are waiting for them, the Outlaws are plotting something in Tavar. That Duke has plans...|
INFO_IKENI7_00011761|The Albs. What? Do you think they will just disappear tomorrow?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011760|Do you think I'd still be alive if I didn't know that already?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011759|What do you think is coming?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011758|The Duke lives on his name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011756|Well, think again, or when you need those shards and you're broke, then I'll really make you pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011755|You think?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011754|So, make your mind up soon.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00011753|Thinking won't earn you profit, favor or shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011752|I'll think about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011751|I'm not doing any sort of job for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011750|And, make sure you're straight and focused when you come and do this job, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011749|So, if you have any 'personal' business to take care of, get it taken care of.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011746|So, listen up. And, you get another chance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011745|I don't do objections. People do as they're told, and they do it when I say.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011743|No. You can take care of that yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011742|I know how the Outlaws treat their captives. That's exactly why I want to get him back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011741|If his belief is being challenged every day?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011740|If the Outlaws have starved him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011739|Do I want to know if he's being tortured?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011738|Do you want to know how Frank is doing?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011737|I have been trying to hatch a plan for days now to work out how to get him out of there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011736|You've spoken to him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011735|Frank?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011734|Frank gave me your coordinates in the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011733|And, I don't respond well to hostility, how do you want this to do down?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011732|And, yet you expect me to believe you are who you say you are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011731|Come on, speak up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011730|I asked you about the password, So, why didn't you answer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011729|Then, maybe, I'll finally understand what our purpose is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011727|I am certain that I can get something from the recordings that will be of use to all of us. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011726|I would like to give you the following, in any case, before you are on your way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011725|Good, great!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011724|I'll think about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011723|And, when he could take the pain no longer, it is said that he left the people with the words of Calaan and went up in to the great light.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011722|According to the lore, grief about the unreasonableness of people tore him apart from the inside.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011721|Well, sure, okay. Like I said, he's the founder of our order.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011720|But, that's exactly my point. I want to know more, but only certain scholars are allowed to see the texts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011718|Some say that he rose to heaven to Calaan, others claim that he set forth to find the reason for the crater.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011717|Scholars are still arguing to this day about what the great light is exactly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011716|It is likely that he saw his time coming.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011715|Some uneducated people wanted to proclaim him a god, even during his lifetime, but he always spurned this idea.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011714|All seems a bit vague.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011713|Yes, I know! I mean, some details have been lost in time. Some believe Arvid still remains among us, although that is nonsense.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011712|With it, even though our community was small, we were able to defend ourselves from the malice of the godless.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011711|And, our ancestors began research on how Elex could be used for the good of all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011709|He wrote the rules that have bound us here in the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011708|Well, anyways, now you know a little bit more than before.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011707|I've heard enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011706|What did Arvid do?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011705|They reached out to others, but not everyone listened. You can see what became of the rest when you look to Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011704|The first followers were here, in the Hort. They had saved technology from destruction and Calaan showed them how that technology could be used to help all the people of Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011703|After the comet hit, it was his burden and his privilege to lead people into a new future. To save those who had survived.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011702|He was born about 200 years ago, we think, and he was the first to be enlightened by Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011700|Tell me about Arvid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011699|Manners too. I hope you stick around.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011698|Thanks. The food is appreciated.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011697|Dammit, it, it was right here, I had it a moment ago.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011696|But, what if it's something else?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011695|Well, I've not seen it anywhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011694|Think, think, think.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011693|Could it be that again?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011692|Pin 3 bracket arm, I know I forgot one of those last time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011691|But, what was the last thing, not the orbital reset brake, at any rate, I have that... |
INFO_IKENI7_00011690|And... I'm still missing a few screws, of course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011689|Adjustable wrench, retaining rings, pressurized air intake valve...|Trying to remember
INFO_IKENI7_00011688|Dammit what the hell was it, that I was thinking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011687|You know how hard it is to get a moment's peace to think in this place?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011686|Quiet, quiet, quiet. Oh, dammit, that's my line of concentration gone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011685|Do you want my help?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011684|Wait, wait a second. There is still something missing, let me think now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011683|I'll get the things you need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011682|We must show mercy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011681|The Hort demands more soldiers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011680|As I said, it's much too little but that's all I have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011679|Right, well, thank you for everything. I will never forget this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011678|That's all I need to know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011677|I appreciate the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011676|Luckily, I ran straight into the hands of a Cleric patrol, from then it was child's play to get back to Hort from there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011675|When we were ambushed by a molch, I fled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011674|So, I used the next chance I got to get away.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011673|Yes. I could see their suspicions growing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011672|And, were you found out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011671|After all, those Berserkers had nothing else but that damn vegetable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011670|Well, the armor is one thing, but eventually they asked me questions about my job.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011669|So, what happened?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011668|I got a good way from the fort, travelling disguised as a Cultivator.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011667|As you surely remember, Rijka the wife of the Warlord assigned me to a group that was transporting a Seedling.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011666|I'm still breathing, but only just.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011665|Were there any problems during your escape?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011664|This cell doesn't give me a chance to hide anything from the eyes of the Clerics. Okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011663|But, when you get the stuff, bring it all together, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011662|There is no need to thank me, all are welcome here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011661|I can't force you to trust me. But, look around, learn more about us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011660|Thank you, I will stay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011659|I don't trust traitors, no matter how friendly they pretend to be.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011658|You should find the roots growing there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011657|In the middle of the lake there is a pile of dirt the size of a troll shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011656|Just head east until you are above Goliet and you will reach a plateau with a lake.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011655|You don't know? Well, my sources say they should be easy enough to find.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011654|Where do the healing roots grow?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011650|But, think before you make any accusations, the people serving here are loyal Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011649|But, if you think someone here is involved in this, then I hope you find them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011648|And, you have your orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011647|I have nothing to hide.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011646|Chem smuggling is a vile trade that eats the lives of all those involved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011645|If I did, I would have dealt with it. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011644|Let me ask you then. Do you know anything about Elex smuggling?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011643|Don't you want to know what I am looking for? |
INFO_IKENI7_00011642|I have never met anyone like you. That's appreciated, thanks!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011641|Even though I tried to escape?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011640|But, this is all I have. That's it, every shard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011638|I will pay the rest to Chloe.|humane
INFO_IKENI7_00011636|If I had more, I would give you more. Logical, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011635|Hey, I might be an ass, but I'm not an idiot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011634|You're really telling me that is everything?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011633|And, if she finds out about Cindy, both me and her are dead. Dead for good.|Down, scared
INFO_IKENI7_00011632|I've never had much here. I don't know why she picked me of all people, but now she owns me until I die.|Miserable
INFO_IKENI7_00011631|And, have you met any of her exes here in the Fort? No. And there's a good reason for that. No one knows where they are. Where the pieces of them are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011630|I'm not the first, you know. Every few months she picks a husband|Talking fast, scared
INFO_IKENI7_00011629|She means the world to me. If I wasn't with her, my universe would end.|Scared of his wife.
INFO_IKENI7_00011628|Split? Split up? the only thing that would split would be my head and my shoulders if I tried that!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011627|If things are so bad, why don't you split up with your wife?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011626|So, your wife doesn't mean anything to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011625|So, are you going to pay?|Back to business - worried
INFO_IKENI7_00011622|There was something hanging there.|Considering the wall
INFO_IKENI7_00011621|He had the deluded idea that we should give up magic and take up guns.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011620|The Pilgrim has committed us to finding a way to win this war with magic. To spread the lie of technology at such a time is treason.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011619|Give up studying magic to fight an arms race we can't win? Commit ourselves to the use of pure Elex, forbidden by Amrek and the Pilgrim?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011618|Why not use both?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011617|He had fallen under the spell of technology.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011615|What crime did Stormson commit?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011614|Well, now it is part of the job.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011613|Killing Albs wasn't the job you gave me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011611|Their death is the only way to ensure justice. Avenge Rogar's death.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011610|You want me to kill the Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011609|Now go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011608|Speak to Jora if you have any more questions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011607|I hope you now understand our Laws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011606|Carelessness costs. So, listen well this time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011605|Tell me about the laws again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011604|If you have taken our Laws to heart, then, yes, there is something you can help me with.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011603|Ignorance of the law is no excuse.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011602|I didn't know that Elex was forbidden.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011601|Here, take this. You can start practicing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011600|I'm lucky I learned a craft.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011599|I mean, this is where my skills are needed. It's better that I build machines to fight than I get my...myself killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011598|Yes, I...I'm lucky I guess. I would rather do my work here than get sent to the front.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011597|And, are you happy with that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011596|And, I've no idea when they'll allow me back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011595|I'm barred, punishment for breaking in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011594|You think I haven't thought of that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011593|Why don't you ask if you can work in the Archives?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011592|I beg you, I want to understand why they won't teach us these things.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011591|Nobody. But, please, I need your help|
INFO_IKENI7_00011590|Who says I will help you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011589|Hope you like it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011588|I found that out by the crater, nice piece isn't it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011587|Here, take this. Always good to meet a fellow enthusiast.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011586|Hah! Yeah, yet, weirdly when I start talking about that stuff in bars, I put people to sleep.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011585|I can't sleep at night for my excitement over electrolysis and carbon monoxide reactions.|Straight
INFO_IKENI7_00011584|I am ?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011583|Yeah...right.|Unimpressed
INFO_IKENI7_00011582|You bang the rocks together, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011581|You're mistaken.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011579|Well then, good luck.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011578|We cannot allow that. I will not allow that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011577|And if they find the deposit before you're finished?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011576|We will have to mine it quickly before they do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011575|What will you do if the Albs in Xacor learn about this deposit?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011573|I can only offer you what I have here. The Elex deposit requires extraction and processing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011572|I should have expected this question.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011571|And what about giving me a share of the Elex?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011570|No, no. I am happy with what I have, thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011569|Do you want some new clothing?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011568|If you can't use them then I'm sure you can sell them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011567|Here, you look like you could use some clothes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011566|But, I do have a spare set that you can have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011564|Well, other than stopping me having to walk round naked in front of my friend here, no. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011563|Well, if they don't mean anything to you, then you don't really have a use for them, do you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011562|It sometimes takes a while for them to move on, but I've got used to that, it gives me some thinking time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011561|You mean the animals out here? Yeah, they aren't nice at all. But, we've got a stack of boards so we can always barricade the house until they go away.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011560|The Albs aren't your only threat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011559|We haven't needed any protection.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011558|The Albs just seem to ignore this place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011557|Who protects your fields?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011556|All right, here take and an advance and let's get on with this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011555|Cautious bastard aren't you? Is that why it took so long?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011554|No, you're going to pay me first. Got it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011553|Give me the Elex and you'll get the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011552|Pay me, then we'll talk about the Elex.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011551|There, I can't do anything more for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011550|I see you have learned the ways of the Free People.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011549|And what about me? Do you have any gear I could use?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011548|Do so.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011547|I will pass her the message.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011545|But, if you steal from those with nothing, then I don't want anything from you. I like to keep things honest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011544|I'd rather you get the supplies honestly, but... if you take them from people who have too much, who am I to question it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011543|Try, yeah. Achieving is something different.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011542|Most people try to earn a profit in your situation, huh?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011541|We won't get in their way. We don't want Elex, they have to see that. They'd be attacking us for nothing. No, no, it's the Clerics.|Rejecting this, certain of his argument
INFO_IKENI7_00011540|The Albs want all the Elex. All of it, no matter where it is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011539|So, why should they show any interest in attacking a fortified position to get it instead of sweeping up all there is out there?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011537|But, those guys are only interested in Elex and, as far as I know, there isn't any more here in the City than there is elsewhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011536|Executions, Converters, torture. Believe me, I know all about that shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011534|I suppose I should give you something to help you out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011533|But...yeah, if I'm going to talk about the need to fight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011532|Well, this is like being back in Tavar, people asking for things and expecting to just get them.|Accepting that there is some truth in it after all.
INFO_IKENI7_00011531|And you want me to give you that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011530|Well, if there's going to be an invasion, I'm going to need some ammunition.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011529|The Albs are more of a threat than the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011528|So, take what you have and get out of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011527|You already have everything I owned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011525|You stole from me!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011524|That is everything I have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011523|Here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011522|It will take more than words to get me to leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011521|I got it, I got it!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011520|You had better leave people alone from now on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011519|There, you won't get more from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011518|Done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011517|There, are we done?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011516|I thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011515|Thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011514|It's self evident that the paths of all the factions will cross and that conflict is likely.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011513|Them? All I can trust them to make is a crater.|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00011512|Get one of your guys to make your grenades.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011511|Hah, I like you, you're smart. I can use smart. Here, take these parts. Work your magic.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011510|Exactly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011509|With a what?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011508|Any idiot can blow themselves up with a faulty trigger pin. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011507|Any idiot can make grenades.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011506|And, for early adopters, I'm offering a stack of grenades as a special gift. If I can get someone to make them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011505|I can make grenades.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011504|Scrap and salvage it is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011503|Of course. I can supply that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011502|Here, just don't pay attention to the rust spots.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011501|Give me the salvage.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011500|I need some ammunition.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011499|Show me the weapons you have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011498|No? Hmm, well, that's your decision.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011497|I don't need anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011496|So, what are you looking for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011495|Why? Are you wanting to trade? I only deal with the right type of person, but...I could bring myself to deal with you. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011494|You know, basic stuff such as weapons, ammunitions, high grade salvage, that kind of stuff.|Growing in courage as the player listens
INFO_IKENI7_00011493|All right, all right, so, in addition to food, the scavengers also bring me various items they find out buried in the sand.|Admitting
INFO_IKENI7_00011492|Smart one aren't you? |
INFO_IKENI7_00011491|You know exactly what I'm talking about.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011490|Nothing. Where did you get that information? I...have no idea what you're talking about.|Shifty, a bad liar
INFO_IKENI7_00011489|What else do you give out apart from food?|Pointed
INFO_IKENI7_00011488|But...maybe, someday I'll pick your brains about what you know. Until then, keep training.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011487|No, no way. You'll shove you face in the dirt as soon as one turns up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011486|Better by running, than hiding in a hole.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011485|Are you trying to tell me you could evade their target tracking systems?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011483|Will that be the Mk VII, or the VII, with the reswept intakes? Because, hiding won't work for those things, you're best dodging the attack runs then aiming for the lateral vents.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011482|So, you say, but I'll bet as soon as you see an Alb raider flying over your head you'll crawl into a hole like everyone else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011481|I know how to defend myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011480|Here, this is for you. The lesson was worth it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011479|Ah, crap. I didn't think I'd forgotten anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011478|Misfires, but...well, um...|
INFO_IKENI7_00011477|And, your weapon, is the barrel clean or does it misfire?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011476|But, I promise you, I want to see recruits kept alive, not sacrificed for vain causes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011475|Now, you must trust those who lead it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011474|You chose your cause.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011473|And you think people should just obey orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011472|So, deliver that and make sure you don't get killed doing it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011471|Why are we sending them out to die? |
INFO_IKENI7_00011470|We're short enough of recruits as it is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011469|People need training and we need veterans in amongst the recruits.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011468|The Hort has to understand what's going on here. Everyday I'm sending recruits out and I don't know if they'll come back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011467|If you want the message delivered then tell me what it's about.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011466|Your job is to deliver this. Not to question its contents.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011465|You are the messenger.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011464|That is a matter for Balder at the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011463|What is it that you need the Hort to know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011462|You're a piece of work, you know that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011461|You'll get nothing from me, the weak should not be rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011460|Then take this and get out of my face.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011459|Yes of course. Just give me a few shards and I'll go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011458|You'd better start listening to me.|Warning tone
INFO_IKENI7_00011457|Yeah, and I am the Pilgrim.|Sarcastic
INFO_IKENI7_00011456|I am here to help you. I was sent by the workers in Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011454|I will. Take care.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011453|Good luck with that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011452|Hey, a lady knows how to budget.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011451|Didn't you say you were out of money?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011450|Here, for your subtlety.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011449|And, I am sure those people will pay out a few shards to buy peace now that I am back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011448|A lot of people stabbed me in the back when I was condemned to exile.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011447|Nothing gets by you, does it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011446|Business? Sounds like you're planning to start more trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011445|Have faith, something always turns up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011444|Getting all that stuff without getting killed. I'd still rather get my old bow back.|Protesting
INFO_IKENI7_00011443|Then where's your problem?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011442|He pointed at some trees he said were good and said something about animal sinew, or hide, or something from a plant.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011441|Didn't Geron tell you anything?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011440|You must be able to find the materials you need around here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011439|Make a new one? Where would I even start?|Despondent
INFO_IKENI7_00011438|Yeah, thanks, thanks for that.|Down
INFO_IKENI7_00011437|There's magic out there and you dig fields. You must feel pretty pathetic.|Put down
INFO_IKENI7_00011436|Thanks. Sometimes it takes an outsider to put things in perspective.|Brightening
INFO_IKENI7_00011435|And, you're the one working to make it happen.|Supportive
INFO_IKENI7_00011434|Yeah. Contrary to what everyone thinks, magic doesn't appear out of thin air. It takes work.|Pleased to be acknowledged
INFO_IKENI7_00011433|I live with it everyday, it's become normal to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011432|Edan is the only place magic exists outside of Xacor, it's only natural that people wonder about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011431|You must get questioned by newcomers a lot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011430|There's no point saying unless you're prepared to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011429|If you say so.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011428|We'll never survive if we don't believe in change and that means listening to the things that are wrong. That is why we're different from Albs and Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011427|You sound like Akira now. But, I can't think like that. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011426|Something tells me your attitude could get you into trouble here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011420|Duty is duty and you cannot pass.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011419|But, you're still not coming in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011418|Well, I admire people who speak clearly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011417|I am going in. Over your dead body if necessary.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011415|But, I do have beer, how about that? And the next round is on you. Here, for your persistence.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011414|Of course not, you don't have any.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011413|Honorable doesn't mean 'stupid', or 'unable to look after yourself'. So, don't try and hoodwink me over my honor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011412|I've got honor, I'm honorable.|Protesting
INFO_IKENI7_00011411|So much for the 'honor' of the Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011410|If ever there were a way to get people killed needlessly, then sending them against a troll is it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011409|It's easy to talk of killing a troll, but I am responsible for the lives of the men I asked to do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011408|Finally, someone who draws the right conclusions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011407|Then you're right, you should avoid that area.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011406|He's proved himself wise so far.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011404|I trust in the Pilgrim to make those decisions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011403|So, please, trade while you're here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011402|Oh, we need as much of it as possible to buy the things we need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011401|So, you won't be confiscating my Elexit?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011400|If it was something the Pilgrim wanted he would have found a way to do it, but he hasn't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011399|Maybe, but like I said, technology is a curse.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011398|There is a process that would let you extract the Elex.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011397|Take this. But, that really is as all I can give you for now.|Apologetic
INFO_IKENI7_00011396|Yes, you don't look like you're someone who lives a quiet life.|With a smile
INFO_IKENI7_00011395|Besides, the more people who can patch themselves up, the less time we'll have to spend picking up the pieces.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011394|We are here to heal.|Dutiful
INFO_IKENI7_00011393|Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011392|I could do with more of those. It's dangerous out there|
INFO_IKENI7_00011391|Shards, right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011390|Take these shards as a sign of my thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011389|And, the shards you promised me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011388|But, please don't squander it. Those were my emergency reserves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011386|Alright, alright. You win, just get me the club, please!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011385|Is your life worth something to you, or not?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011384|Why do you think you're in a position to negotiate?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011383|Scratch your back? Why would I...oh, a reward, you want paying? You don't think you could just do this to help?|Not understanding the turn of phrase.
INFO_IKENI7_00011382|I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011381|Right, right. I'll be waiting here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011380|I will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011379|As soon as the next Seedling harvest is in, we will make that happen. Thanks for reminding me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011378|You're right, we should stop talking and make it happen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011377|We've talked about it. And the growing conditions are right there.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00011376|Why don't you plant healing roots near the Seedling fields? They'd be easier to defend.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00011375|Good. Now, get to work.|Friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00011374|Alright.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011373|Very well, you did your job. You will get your payment.|Grudging
INFO_IKENI7_00011372|Wait, I said the payment needed to be worth the risk. This doesn't come close.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011371|But, we must complete the mission first. Listen up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011370|All right, all right. As long as you get the job done. And, if Elexit is what it takes to make sure you do that, you'll get paid..|Businesslike, sour
INFO_IKENI7_00011369|You do whatever you want, but if I'm hunting Albs, the reward should fit the risk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011368|Do you think I'm out here for Elexit? Duty is worth more than shards.|As in, he is acting for duty not reward.
INFO_IKENI7_00011367|You want me to risk my life without reward?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011366|Here, take this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011365|Actually, we're short of everything, blame the Comet and decades of war. But...you have a point.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011364|This town isn't bankrupt, you have a lot of things you can pay with apart from Elexit.|Observing
INFO_IKENI7_00011363|What makes you say that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011362|You must have something to offer apart from shards.|Observing
INFO_IKENI7_00011361|It's up to us to tidy up the mess that those machines have already made.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011360|You have my absolute word that this is official business. I told you, we need this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011359|Amrek and the Pilgrim agree. Magic is nature's cure. Technology it's curse. The World Hearts will purify Magalan without the need for machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011357|And, where do we stop on that road? When we are feeding people into that machine like they do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011356|Why not use Alb technology to get the Elex you need?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011355|And, if I get caught bringing Elex into Goliet? |Remembering the test he was set.or the Law
INFO_IKENI7_00011354|I'm trying to help you avoid a problem.|Firm but fair
INFO_IKENI7_00011353|I've seen one, I've seen several.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011352|It's an adjutor. Haven't you seen one before?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011327|Desperate times call for desperate measures.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011326|Blow the dam? That's as crazy as one of the Duke's ideas.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011325|No one will be seeing a thing unless we get that detonator back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011324|That dam is going to make one hell of a bang. I hope I'm here to see it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011323|Moral dilemmas tend to go out of the window quickly when you're under fire from people who want to feed you into a Converter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011322|The moral dilemma, are all means justified in war?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011321|And risk the Albs learning our plan? That's too big a risk.|Regretful, but firm.
INFO_IKENI7_00011320|There must be a way to warn the Free People in this area before you blow the dam.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011319|But, all discussion is worthless until we can reacquire that detonator.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011318|There. Can you think of a more effective solution?|Rhetorical question.
INFO_IKENI7_00011317|Blowing the dam has an 89.54% chance of entirely destroying any attacking force.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011316|And you think the Hort is to blame for that? The 'oh so peaceful Berserkers' who call their leaders warlords. You don't even see your own hypocrisy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011315|If you buried your pride and found ways to work with the other Free People this decision wouldn't be necessary.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011314|Typical Berserker, can't see the wood for the trees.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011313|Typical Clerics, sacrificing the lives of others for their own twisted purpose.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011312|You share that view with Egon, but griping won't help us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011311|I am surprised they don't have both detonators seeing how incompetently things are run around here.|Scathing
INFO_IKENI7_00011310|Yup, we will. Plenty better things to do that mess with giant plants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011309|Good. Do that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011308|No problem. We'll stay well away from the giant plant. Won't we?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011307|Keep talking. I've heard it all before.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011306|By? No. I'd go straight through you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011305|I have a job to do and I'll do it. You won't get by me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011304|Any shit? I bet if I came for you you'd shit yourself. I bet if I came for you I could make you eat your own shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011303|You can look, but don't touch. Clear?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011302|Can we observe the World Heart from a distance? I would like to understand more about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011300|Your robot friend might not get it, but you understood me, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011299|Scanning. Unable to locate any shit. Please restate your intentions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011298|Caja, you know I appreciate you, but I make the rules here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011297|Thorgal, you can drop the threats.|Recognising him
INFO_IKENI7_00011296|Why would you even ask that? Let's just get along then we can all have a good day.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011295|And, what if we don't?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011293|The Duke knows where I am and you can fuck off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011292|Well, if it isn't, Hunter. The Duke's been asking after you.|Recognising Hunter
INFO_IKENI7_00011291|I've got plans. I'm just working on a way to get myself into the city with my balls still attached.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011290|Really? From what I can see the profit's in the city and you're standing cradling your balls out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011289|Now, now, don't be hasty, Nasty, I've still got my eye on the profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011288|Hunter. So, this is the corner you've found to piss in.|Recognising Hunter
INFO_IKENI7_00011287|The Duke is the rightful ruler of the Fort. I'm loyal to the Duke. I just don't want to do what he says.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011286|So, tell me, are you planning on leaving Tavar for good? And, if so, have you renounced the Duke and are starting your own faction?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011285|There's no profit in the law, he's planning something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011284|That's you Berserkers, you always have been small-minded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011283|So, Outlaws from Tavar standing by the Council's law? Now there's something I never saw coming..|
INFO_IKENI7_00011282|That's a shame. I can think of a few surprises that thing could give our Cleric friends.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011281|It's not for sale.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011280|Sounds like your drone has a few short circuits. I'll give you half price for it.|Following some drone beeps.
INFO_IKENI7_00011279|Yes, and what will you want after that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011278|Oh, we aren't the Outlaws here, we are the people who want what the law says we should.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011277|Outlaws aren't known for their patience, what are you up to?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011276|Well, we have expectations that our wish will be granted, if that's what you mean?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011275|They must be planning something. No one would just sit here and wait without some sort of a plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011274|Sure, yeah. Of course. I mean look at it and all the...the...plants and stuff.|Trying to enthuse, but not finding a reason
INFO_IKENI7_00011273|This place is my life, it means something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011272|I thought I had a shit life, but you've really planted yourself in a dung heap, haven't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011271|So, each of us steals from the next and the whole world become Tavar? I won't stoop to that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011270|There's always someone weaker than you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011269|There must be some soft asses near here who you can steal from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011268|The Clerics don't care about logic, or about us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011267|It would be desirable to achieve some type of mercantile exchange, that would be a logical way of supporting both parties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011266|And where are the Berserkers to offer us protection? They're just as bad as the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011265|If you're not in a faction then you're prey to all of them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011264|You could build them to the sky, the Clerics would just blow a hole in them. We can't keep them out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011263|The defensive value of these fortifications is minimal. Advise demolition and reconstruction to protect assets.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011262|The tragedy of war. The weak suffer at the hands of the strong.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011261|And, how strong will they be when we die and they starve?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011260|I wouldn't care either. The weak are there to serve the strong.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011259|We would have starved if it wasn't for the little people gave to us. Give him a chance, hey?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011258|This guy reminds me of my brother, we had to beg for a while when we ran short of shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011257|Tried that, I'm no good as a thief.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011256|Fucking beggars. Have some pride, steal what you need.|To the beggar
INFO_IKENI7_00011254|And unless you show me the shards, you won't find out. Come on, do us both a favor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011253|Data is always useful, but I am uncertain what this individual can offer us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011252|What do you think? Will you give him something?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011251|Useful, I can be useful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011250|A couple of shards, could save us more, if he does know something useful.|Considering, to the player
INFO_IKENI7_00011249|If you need intelligence, I'm your man. Nothing gets by me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011248|Analyzing...small donation recommended. Local intelligence would be valuable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011247|Give him the shards. He really needs them and, we could do with some information.|Persuasive
INFO_IKENI7_00011246|Come on, have a little heart. Just a few shards, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011245|You see guys like your friend there have made sure I have to beg.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011244|Tell us what? Where to wallow in the shit? Don't waste your shards on this skinflap.|Aggressive, then advising the player
INFO_IKENI7_00011243|You know, helping the Duke out is probably a good idea. He gets kind of pissed when he finds out you didn't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011242|You really shouldn't talk to Nasty like that. Now, am I getting my information, or what?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011241|This isn't your decision.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011240|He's right. The Clerics are plotting something and we need to put our foot right through whatever the fuck it is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011239|These shards should make it a lot easier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011238|Determining which Faction to help against another is a very complex decision.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011236|Don't worry, there's no getting involved. You shouldn't have any trouble finding something out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011235|So, what do you think? Should we get involved here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011234|Ah, no, buddy. I mean other information. But, thanks for the offer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011233|Temporary access to internal data banks requires access authorization. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011232|I am not sure we should get involved. This isn't our fight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011231|That shouldn't be difficult. Let's get this done and take the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011228|Good. Cos the last guy who tried buying things here with unicorn balls ended up eating his own.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011227|And don't start on with trying to barter your way with Raptor shit, you'll need Elexit, or decent Old World scrap if you want to make a deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011226|Everyone uses Elexit as money.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011225|What else are we going to use?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011224|You use shards as money?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011223|Whatever you decide to do with those shards, I'd advise against buying a desert with them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011222|Holy shit, you could buy most of the desert with that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011221|No, Outlaw, I don't sponsor my enemies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011220|Not a bad set of profit. So, are you going to spring something for me, Warlord Rag?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011219|I'm glad you think so.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011218|I believe it should be categorized as generous.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011217|This amount seems more than appropriate for the task.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011216|Then you can assure your friend that he is valued.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011215|That's a lot of shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011214|You have your reward. Now, some advice. Choose yourself a better travelling companion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011213|You never did understand the skills and responsibilities of leadership, Caja. Take your reward and be satisfied you earned it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011212|My magic Warlord's hat.|Sarcastic
INFO_IKENI7_00011211|Just where did you get all these shards from, Ragnar?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011210|I set the terms here in Goliet. You have your reward, be satisfied that you have it and that you get to stay in the city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011209|Take that amount and then double it. Then you'll be closer to what you owe us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011207|Shards are the only cause Outlaws understand.|Disparaging
INFO_IKENI7_00011206|Hey, asshole, you ask someone to put their life on the line for you and your cause, you better have the shards to back that request up!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011205|With friends like you, I'm surprised more people haven't become hermits.|Sarcasm
INFO_IKENI7_00011204|You want to ask this asshole to pay you? No. No, you can't do that, he obviously needs every shard he can get to pay people to be his friends.|Sarcasm
INFO_IKENI7_00011203|As a matter of principle is it? Very well then...|Persuaded
INFO_IKENI7_00011202|Without Elex there is no Mana. Without Mana there is no magic. Without magic there could be no Berserkers. I believe payment for our assistance is more than merited|Logic
INFO_IKENI7_00011201|Yes, yes, maybe you're right. Here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011200|Jora, you always were stingy. You should encourage those who support you and your work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011199|A person should talk for himself, not use a machine to talk for him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011198|This reward does not match the risk involved in this venture. I would recommend an increase in the reward commensurate with the risk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011197|Well, the task was well done. All right then, Caja, you've persuaded me to sweeten the deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011196|Jora, you should really be more generous.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011195|And threats will land you in trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011194|Leave this skinflap to me, I will get you some Elexit.|To the player
INFO_IKENI7_00011193|Pay? I will tell Ragnar that you helped me. My word is payment enough.|Jora believes in duty, not paying for things
INFO_IKENI7_00011192|Good, then you can pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011190|We have each other's backs, that's what counts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011189|You've chosen to travel alongside someone else you must understand something about community and working for others.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011188|Freedom. The chance to dig shit pits for other people if they ask you too. You're better to be completely free.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011187|Freedom, profit and a chance for all. A better deal than this place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011186|Does the Duke promise freedom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011185|Fuck Baxter, he's gone. His legacy is gone. You should return and swear loyalty to the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011184|Hundreds? We intend to be around for thousands!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011183|An interesting social experiment, though we will have to wait centuries to see if this small band can indeed evolve into a faction of comparable size, power and influence to those already in existence.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011182|I hope this is not so rare. We hope others can agree with our views.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011181|It seems we have found a group of people intending to live by their values. A rare thing indeed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011180|No robot can truly understand freedom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011179|Analyzing the word 'free' there are many meanings of this word. Please specify which meaning you are using.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011178|It is what I am determined to see happen for us all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011177|It is right to believe in the Free People. If only more could follow that course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011176|Free', I hear that word so much, yet look at these human ticks. Feeding on scraps left by the factions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011175|If it's shards you want, it's shards you can have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011174|Shards, shards, shards, every time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011173|The lot? We had a deal, stick to the deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011172|Take the lot if you want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011171|Fuck it, just get this over with.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011170|Interesting. You could simply take the shards, or take the goods and trade yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011169|The shards could come in useful...|
INFO_IKENI7_00011168|Everything? Now slow down, my little friend. That wasn't the deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011167|A further option would be to take everything through force.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011165|It is always good to have a choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011164|You can't go wrong with Elexit. It's universal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011163|But, I can get some if you help me. Please!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011162|Relax. I'm only interested in profit and you don't have any.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011161|Hey, you don't want to hurt me, do you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011160|Sounds like this guy got turned over. Shame we weren't here earlier to do it ourselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011159|Hey, don't be hasty. I hit hard times, you can trust me to turn them around.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011158|If we help him he'll just fuck up again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011157|If he's fucked up this much he doesn't understand profit.|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00011156|What I have left in my possession is not available for sale. If it was, I'd sell it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011155|It does not appear that this trader has lost everything. We should clarify what is in his possession before we talk terms.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011154|Yes, finally sense. Let's talk terms.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011153|We should at least find out his terms.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011152|How about I reemploy you as a pisspot?|To CRONY
INFO_IKENI7_00011151|If a trader has no goods, they are unable to trade. I would recommend that he finds an alternative choice of employment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011150|These are desperate times. If he is prepared to work to survive, we should help him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011149|You're failing to do business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011148|Death? What the fuck? I'm just trying to do business here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011147|Failure breeds failure. You remember the rules, failure deserves death.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011146|No, that's fine, that's just less competition. You strive away and let Ray take care of the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011145|Your personal riches are secondary. It is not what we strive to accomplish here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011144|By free, you mean, released, right? Not like, we can never earn a profit again?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011143|Great. I feel so...forgiven. So, completely guilt, fucking, free. |Sarcasm
INFO_IKENI7_00011142|Experiences yes. But, most people come with fears and worries and guilt from their past. Here is a place to forget those things.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011141|Interesting. So, you think we should wipe our memories? Surely our experiences could prove useful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011140|And, some will say anything just to get you to do their dirty work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011139|All causes require conviction. All causes require faith.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011138|Everyone deserves a new start. But, that doesn't include brain washing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011137|It appears to be in need of an overhaul, or replacement.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011136|An Alb drone. An interesting piece of salvage. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011135|The past sets rules for us to follow, but for individuals, each must have a chance to rewrite themselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011134|This is the worst place to come for that, the Clerics define themselves by the past. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011133|We should leave before we start to believe it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011132|Free? This one really has been brainwashed with all this Calaan babble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011130|And, you're the most useless example of an Outlaw ever to walk Tavar, Ray.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011129|Just to warn you, Eli's a slippery, murderous shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011128|Eli, you're a dipshit for getting caught. But, he's one of my dipshits, so we should get him out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011127|It wasn't murder, it was early self-defense.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011125|Interesting. Do we help this murdering Outlaw, or do we leave him stuck in this morally objectionable situation? This is a dilemma.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011124|And, you're going to listen to that tree loving throwback?|To the player
INFO_IKENI7_00011123|I don't think we should interfere in this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011122|I don't know. Outlaws, Clerics, they are enemies at war, |
INFO_IKENI7_00011121|Why would I do that? I'm a prisoner. You can see that!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011120|Analysis indicates that this individual will attempt to deceive you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011119|I know the dangers, but it is very wrong for him to be kept against his will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011117|I don't know why the Clerics would want this pathetic waste of skin, or why we should help him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011116|There's a risk and a reward. What means the most to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011115|Deal. It's got to be. Straight profit with someone else doing the work? Hell, yeah.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011114|Look, whatever he's talking about, this is a good deal, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011113|Interesting. A conflict between financial gain, social advancement and moral opposites, I will be fascinated to learn your decision.|Interested.
INFO_IKENI7_00011112|Betrayal. And betrayal to help a chem dealer. You shouldn't trust this asshole for a second.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011111|You see? Everyone can come out a winner from this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011110|This potential source of income offers reasonable reward at a low risk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011109|And, risk yourself in the Hort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011108|Risk? Who's at risk? No one has come close to catching me until now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011107|Do you really want to associate yourself with a chem dealer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011106|You see? Everyone can come out a winner from this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011105|An Outlaw debasing Clerics and offering you a chance to earn from it. Hah, you should take the deal. Both those factions can rot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011104|If you won't eat it, I will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011103|If we had the resources to make alcohol, do you think we'd be making food like this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011102|Weurk, do you have anything to drink? I think I'd need to be hammered before I ate that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011101|It might not be the best you can taste, but a healthy mind and body is better than a dead mind and body.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011100|Interesting. They emphasize nutrition over appearance and taste here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011099|Recruitment through the stomach, maybe we should try that more often in Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011098|I wish it wasn't the first time I'd heard that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011097|Analysis of the ingredients suggests that despite appearances, this food is of nutritional benefit and harmless to the digestive tract.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011096|Reaching out, it's the only way to prove we mean what we say.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011095|Yeah? It's nice to know at least one other person gets that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011094|Thank you. We must all work together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011093|And, you think you can achieve that with stew?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011092|All the Free People must work together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011091|They waste resources on enemies and cowards. No wonder they are losing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011090|If it was an easy job it would have been done already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011089|Chem dealers? Bound to have weapons, bound to be pissed if you poke into their business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011087|If people can make a profit and there are those who want it, what's the problem? Your Calaan has a stick up his ass.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011086|The tired, the weak minded, the vulnerable are being preyed upon. These animals are adept at spotting those who are susceptible.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011085|It is interesting that in a faction that focuses on data its people are seeking an escape through chems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011084|Good, I will look forward to hearing how you progress.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011083|Getting rid of some chem dealers and getting paid for it. I think we should do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011082|If he knew, he'd've dealt with them already, finding them is our job.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011081|Insufficient personal data available to identify the chem dealers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011080|It is clear to me that we must face the Albs together. It is the Berserkers who have clung to our history of warfare.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011079|Then remember that next time you send your Mechs into Edan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011078|We are bound together by our weaknesses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011077|It is significant that Elex causes so many problems everywhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011076|Try and deal here and you will give me a reason to have you executed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011075|Let's find these dealers and take the chems for ourselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011074|Discussing it is a waste of time. Get it done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011073|That is a waste of time. He just wants work done for free. Who cares about this 'Rogar'?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011072|A 'bug hunt'? Well, you travel with her, I hope you understand her choice of language better than I do. Find Rogar, do what you want with your 'bugs'.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011071|Whatever, as long as this babysitting job doesn't turn into a bug hunt.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011070|I'm glad you agree. Find Rogar. I want him back here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011069|So, we complete a task of reparation to improve our relationship with Warlord Angrim? It makes sense for us to complete this task. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011068|Find Rogar quickly and you can return.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011067|Wow, the Valley of the Damned. Not a place I ever wanted to see from the inside.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011066|I would rely on your own skills to find him. If you trust that ball of wires, you'll be lost in the Valley for good.|Scathing, annoyed by the machine.
INFO_IKENI7_00011065|Preparing cartographic data. Projecting Rogar's location.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011064|Now, we find something we agree on, Caja.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011063|Let's do it. Further discussion is pointless.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011062|Without Laws, we might as well be Raptors. There is no point fighting unless you have something to fight for.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011061|Let's do it. We will find better company in the Valley at least we'll be free from this bureaucratic raptor shit. |
INFO_IKENI7_00011060|On that at least, we can agree.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011059|As long as it's not just us being honest. You've got to be straight with us. It has to work both ways, or it won't work at all.|Implying that the Berserkers aren't.
INFO_IKENI7_00011058|Pretty much.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00011057|And there is Tavar in a nutshell.|Sparring
INFO_IKENI7_00011056|Fuck honesty.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00011055|There is right and there is wrong, that's true for both logic and morality.|Straight
INFO_IKENI7_00011054|This is a fascinating, despite all the variables it appears that many people operate on strict binary principles..|Interested
INFO_IKENI7_00011053|A reformed outsider, now a fully committed Berserker. You are an inspiration to others.|An edge of prejudice amongst the praise.
INFO_IKENI7_00011052|You know that serving Goliet comes first. I have made my pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011051|Just so we understand each other. That also applies to you, Duras.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011050|And, you wonder why we don't put our faith in technology.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011049|I wasn't talked to you, drone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011048|Adjusting personality settings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011047|Stubborn as always. It's a crime that someone with your talents was born with that attitude, Caja.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011046|I am not accountable to you, Angrim, play your games with someone else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011045|Otherwise, you'll set him back on the path of reason, right, Caja?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011044|An opportunity to move on. We'll see if you are reasonable enough to take it.|Stressing the 'reason' in reasonable.
INFO_IKENI7_00011043|An appeal to reason, I am flattered.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011042|I can't say I'm confident about our chances, but we have to try.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011041|It has in the past.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011040|Maybe talking can make a difference.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011039|Not talking to each other has given us nothing but war. We need to start somewhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011038|You are putting yourself in a position of weakness. What Outlaw can be trusted?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011037|I guess you're not giving our quest a high chance of success then?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011036|You want to talk to the Duke? Hah! Good luck with that!|
INFO_IKENI7_00011035|We have for years. It's the Clerics who keep invading our territory. Or, are you just lost?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011034|So, you know him? Well, you can tell him I speak the truth. Our enemy is in Xacor. We must all recognize that.|Wary
INFO_IKENI7_00011033|Oh, the Duke is a threat. He'll piss over your corpses when he finds you're here. But, he's no idiot. Make your words count. And speak honestly. Outlaws can spot raptorshit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011032|I couldn't agree more, but the sooner we start seeking common ground, the more likely we are to find it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011031|Beginning communication will be tricky. Getting people to agree on concepts can prove extremely frustrating.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011030|A Berserker and a diplomat. You speak like those of old who brought the first Council together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011029|Who are you calling old?|A joke
INFO_IKENI7_00011028|You're right. The Free People must come together if we are to survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011026|I don't want your analysis. This is something we have to do, whatever the odds say.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011025|Calculating probability of success for mission completion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011024|All right, all right, no need to get aggressive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011023|You're lucky I don't double the price seeing as it's you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011022|Come on, Spike, he's with me. You can call it quits for Ray, can't you?|Friendly.
INFO_IKENI7_00011021|Wait, wait. Okay, 200 for both of you. All right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011020|Then I suggest we find another way in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011019|It did. Now, it doesn't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011018|I assume that payment covers both of us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011017|I'll give you entertainment, when I shove a sword through your neck.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011016|You wait till you see the entertainment district then say that. Only watch your heart if you do, grandad.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011015|It's a wonder they recruit anyone for that price.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011014|It's 200 to get in. Is that clear enough?|
INFO_IKENI7_00011013|There was no specification of the services that would be supplied. Recommend refusal until these are clarified.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011011|He'll only spend it on chems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011010|Hey, I trust you. I trust you to pay me an honest 200 shards.|Protesting
INFO_IKENI7_00011009|And, welcome to the Fort, home of greed, mistrust and lies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011008|Pay him, before he starts thinking we're friends.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011007|You should listen to him. He talks sense he does.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011006|200 shards seems like a good deal just to get rid of him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011005|Just pay him. He'll only hang around otherwise.|
INFO_IKENI7_00011004|Yes, yes...no. forget it.|

INFO_IKENI7_00011002|Whoa, listen, Bob sometimes...well, he can sometimes...|
INFO_IKENI7_00011001|You'd consider it, but you know you'd end up eating it.|Sparring
INFO_IKENI7_00011000|As if I would ever consider another approach with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010999|Shit, that asshole owed me 500 from the last game. You owe me that now, Bob. And, I want it in shards, not in a box.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010998|And, you'd be amazed at how much that pushes up my profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010997|An interesting mix of emotion and cold logic that displays all the behavioral traits of a psychopath.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010996|Here, take this as a bonus.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010995|Hey, I like your companion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010994|Brutal, but effective. It will certainly send a message.|Observation

INFO_IKENI7_00010988|Good, it's nice to be appreciated.|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00010987|A well planned ambush. It was a good plan.|Grudging admiration
INFO_IKENI7_00010986|A word in confidence, take his advice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010984|It takes a wise man to see the value here, Fortunately, they have me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010983|I can see why they use the term scrap instead of salvage, much of this is in a poor state.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010982|Takes one to know one.|Calm, amused.
INFO_IKENI7_00010981|I'd heard Edan hid a lot of old farts. It seems that is true.|Referring to Duras
INFO_IKENI7_00010980|I'd heard the sands of Tavar hid a lot of Old World material, it seems that is true.|Observation
INFO_IKENI7_00010979|Don't go picking anything up Crony, you might end up as salvage yourself.|

INFO_IKENI7_00010956|If you want to be a leader, be a leader. Answer the damn question. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010955|Oh, yeah, He's right. Those ladies know how to get answers. I mean guys get relaxed over there and they let all sorts of information slip. Hah, got myself in trouble that way before...|Happy recollection
INFO_IKENI7_00010954|As I said, sometimes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010953|I.. What do I do? Oooh, yeah, look, pretty things!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010952|Sometimes even the Doc sees things clearly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010951|Local information is likely and I believe the ladies he is speaking of are likely to learn things in their social environment.|

INFO_IKENI7_00010939|You keep selling, Doc, bring in the profits, but you won't get me sampling it.|

INFO_IKENI7_00010916|Now, what in all of Magalan do you think that thing is?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010915|That place has to have profit in every corner and we are walking right to it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010914|Shit. The Cathedral.|

INFO_IKENI7_00010911|You want me to handle your crap?|

INFO_IKENI7_00010909|Those things are properly programmed, right? They're not just going to see an Outlaw and start firing, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010908|I've been there. And, I can say this about it. It's, well, it's a place that's still there.|Trying to find something to say and failing
INFO_IKENI7_00010907|I've travelled the world. I've seen many things and there's one thing for certain. That's a big, fucking pool of lava.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010906|There is shit everywhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010905|We cross deserts, we find our way across mountains and there is one consistent feature.|

INFO_IKENI7_00010894|The only place in Tavar where you can get frostbite in the desert.|

INFO_IKENI7_00010892|Only problem with structures like this that stand out in the landscape, everyone else can spot them too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010891|But, I'll bet they missed some stuff.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010890|This place has probably been gone over by the scrap collectors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010889|Too late now I suppose.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010888|I don't want to be a Berserker, but you know, a bit more green in the desert wouldn't be a bad thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010887|My brother Tom always had a nose for scrap. He'd dig it out of this place in no time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010886|We might find something usable in there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010885|Shit, shit, I can't believe you got me out here to Xacor, I must be suicidal.|Nervous
INFO_IKENI7_00010884|You don't want to know what runs through my head.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010883|Are you always thinking of scrap?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010882|An air strip. There has to be something here that's worth a good profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010881|Yeah. Shall we look around? See if we can find its balls?|Amused, joking
INFO_IKENI7_00010879|No stranger than anything else I heard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010878|Look at that? Forget Calaan, it seems the Old World worshipped giant, metal penises.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00010877|This makes the Fort look like a paradise.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010876|Fuck me. I'd heard about this place, but wow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010875|I know scrap collectors that would have an orgasm just looking at that place. We should take as much profit as we can while we're here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010874|Probably only small pickings there, the sort of place idiots set up an outpost.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010872|Fuck history. Today is what matters.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010871|Or whatever was here before Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010870|I always said Ignadon was full of shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010869|They got all this stuff yet they were stupid enough to crash our planet into a Comet.|She's not serious about this.

INFO_IKENI7_00010860|I know a lot about Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010859|You know a lot about brothels?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010858|This place will get you sweatier than an Outlaw in a brothel.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010857|And, I thought Bob had the biggest pile of scrap on Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010856|Bloody Baxter's legacy. Albs feeding off our land. Useless asshole.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010855|And is being here all part of your big plan? Can we stop fucking around and get on with things?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010854|There's probably not that much profit in it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010853|So...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010850|Boom. And, a world was wiped out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010849|Now, that fucker would've given everyone a hangover.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010848|Scrap Collectors have been through this place already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010847|One : Nil to the Outlaws. Idiot Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010846|I am glad they're over. It still stinks of piss around here!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010845|My brother and I used this as a place to cook up our plans before we kicked Baxter's ass out of the Fort. Those were days for planning and action.|A little nostalgic
INFO_IKENI7_00010844|Come on out and fight you bastards!|Calling to the Albs
INFO_IKENI7_00010843|Albs. hiding in Xacor, cowering in bunkers.|Sneering
INFO_IKENI7_00010842|The Old World must truly have been an interesting place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010841|An Old World Airport. Records indicate that there was a network of these across Magalan both military and civil.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010839|This device seems to have been designed to transport a payload into orbit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010838|That building is an incredible feat of engineering. We Clerics certainly know how to make science practical.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010837|The knowledge of the Old World has been gathered in this place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010836|The Hort, a place of contemplation and study.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010835|Who knows what they can achieve in the years to come.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010834|Efficient, successful, the Clerics have achieved great things with the technology that was entrusted to them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010833|No. Interesting. I wonder what people in the future will make of the places we have built.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010832|Not just its past.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010831|Records show that such places were built to control regions in Magalan's warring past.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010830|No, no, I think I'd rather imagine seeing the Comet hit the planet.|Not understanding, thinking he was being offered a choice.
INFO_IKENI7_00010829|Imagine being incinerated in a fraction of a second.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010828|Imagine seeing the impact of the Comet with your own eyes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010827|That said, I wouldn't recommend trying the water here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010826|From my reading I would say this must have served as a water treatment facility at one time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010825|Old World vehicles. There are some people who say they were worshipped. We have found numerous small reproductions of these cars, perhaps every home had a place to pray to them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010824|This bar should prove an interesting place for observing local social interactions. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010823|I'd noticed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010822|I am always happy to exchange information.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010821|If there is anything you'd like to know, you just have to ask.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010820|Old World expert aren't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010819|The Fort is not just a term from the present day, this location served as a defensive position in the Old World.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010818|I've heard a lot about it, I am intrigued to see what we find inside.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010817|The Fort of Tavar. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010816|Fascinating.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010815|The fact that this throne is made from scrap also says a lot about the person who sits on it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010814|The throne has long been a symbol of power, conferring power on the person seated on it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010813|An ingenious way of creating an ecosystem that is independent of the outside world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010812|What a remarkable structure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010811|Or, bring other goods in from far away lands. Sometimes I wonder what happened to those places when the Comet hit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010810|This area would trade with other states, across the sea.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010809|Some sort of harbor complex.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010808|I would like more time for extensive research at some point in the future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010806|The drop in temperature near this installation is interesting.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010805|Ingenious.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010804|A low-tech solution to save lives.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010803|For all the Old World's strengths, it was still a place of conflict.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010802|A military base. Or it used to be.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010801|The tenacity the Berserkers show in expanding their territory is pretty remarkable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010800|I don't think it is safe enough to do that at present. But, maybe in the future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010799|If you want to dig, then get at it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010798|Based on its condition and position, I'd say there is a high probability of finding interesting relics from the Old World.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010797|Why here of all places?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010796|This place could be worthwhile of further study.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010795|Xacor really is focused on military success. Their technical achievements are highly impressive.|Interested
INFO_IKENI7_00010794|Can you imagine this place full of them? A chance to take off and explore all of Magalan on a whim? Now, that is magic.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010793|I heard once that people used to have aircraft, similar to the Albs today.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010792|The Old World is still full of surprises.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010791|You think you've seen everything and then you see, whatever the hell that is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010790|Well, if you wanted to know if the Clerics could do teamwork, that building proves it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010789|No wonder so many of them want to spend time outside of Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010788|The Clerics' stronghold. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010787|Seeing that production facility, well you have to admit we're lucky the Clerics can't produce more of them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010786|Well, it might be old but there's fight still left in the place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010785|Whatever we think we're doing, it just takes one giant damn snowball to chance your world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010784|Puts our struggles into perspective doesn't it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010783|They cleaned water here. Turned it from dirty to fresh. Can you imagine that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010782|Is that what this place is?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010781|Old World resources. They had so much stuff, they could even build a palace for shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010780|Sometimes those things offer a dry safe place to sleep in. That can be worth a lot out here  in the wilderness.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010779|Now, here is a reason to cross the Tavar desert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010778|Well, trust the Duke of Tavar to pick that monolith to live in. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010777|You took the words right out of my mouth.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010776|We should be cautious.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010775|The Fort. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010774|Hah! I'd love to see Angrim's face if we made one for him!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010773|Hah. I'd love to see Angrim's face if he saw that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010771|What a sweat box. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010770|Sometimes it's just tempting to throw yourself into it. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010769|The edge of the world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010768|One day we'll be rid of them all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010767|We might have defeated the Albs and destroyed their converter, but the others are still operational.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010764|Even in the Old World people looked out for each other, that's what this place says to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010763|Glad to hear it. Let's move on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010762|I'm not stuck in the past.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010761|Even us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010760|Everything out here used to be something.|

INFO_IKENI7_00010669|You don't like it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010668|The Clerics think they were blessed by their god. What sort of a god would make you live here?|

INFO_IKENI7_00010665|The Clerics are dying out as Magalan is beginning to live again. You think that's a coincidence?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010663|You're saying machines were responsible for the Comet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010662|Replacing people with technology. See where that got the Old World.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010661|That must be hundreds of years old. You think we'd have learned by now...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010660|This whole world is its crater.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010659|Ah...the Comet's crater.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010658|And, from this one place came fire and death and madness.|Solemn
INFO_IKENI7_00010657|It makes a change from even more sand and stones.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010656|Whatever this industrial wreck is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010655|I know some technology can be good, but...I'm glad we're not covering our world in concrete anymore.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010654|It is now, we just don't have as many things.|

INFO_IKENI7_00010652|No, but I've been told, so, hey, you know, just be careful, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010651|Do you go to bars often?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010650|Be careful, I've heard these places can be dangerous.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010649|Big, ugly, overstated and decaying. Welcome, to Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010648|This isn't freedom, this is worse than exile.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010647|They say they want their freedom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010646|With all the things new life could offer Tavar, and the Outlaws fight us to live...here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010645|I'm beginning to feel tempted myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010644|Alcohol, chems and hope would be my guess.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010643|This place stinks. How do they live in this filth?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010642|Even here, life finds a way. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010641|There are stories of the life that used to live in the sea, maybe we can use magic to restore that too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010640|It's hard to believe Albs were once people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010639|What sort of mind can conceive and build something like that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010638|This place has a real peace to it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010637|Not all buildings are without grace.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010636|Of course I worry about you.|Caring
INFO_IKENI7_00010635|Don't worry about me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010634|How are you doing? Does coming to these places ever get to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010633|How could this be an invasion?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010632|I guess they saw it as an invasion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010631|And they killed it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010630|Look, look at what the World Heart was doing here, what it had done for the desert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010629|Ruins, dust and sand everywhere. And still, I am convinced that there is still hope for Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010628|Our whole world could become as bleak as this. I feel sick at the thought of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010627|You see the advances that Elex has brought?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010626|An Alb raider doesn't need anything like this space to take off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010625|A rocket. We should find blueprints, this has possible military potential.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010624|That is why the Albs left them. That is why the Albs will win.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010622|The Clerics spend too much time on insignificancies like that building.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010621|And, so their words echoed in greatness. And, went nowhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010620|But, it is only a matter of time before the Albs come home.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010619|The Hort. You can see why the Albs have failed to take it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010618|If only the Clerics were like their machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010617|Ordered, progressive, efficient.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010616|It won't be long until the Hort is just much of a ruin.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010615|A relic of the past.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010614|In this place Elex came to Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010613|In this place was our future born. Of fire, of death, of ash. The Comet's crater.|Solemn
INFO_IKENI7_00010612|Let's not spend much time in this place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010611|In pain? You should keep up with your training, then you wouldn't complain.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010610|Still faster than walking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010609|Primitive, compared to our raiders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010608|If they took Elex, they wouldn't need alcohol.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010607|In the Old World, maybe, but Alb, or Cleric mechs would turn that to rubble in an hour.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010606|Looks fairly secure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010605|The Duke seeks safety in the past. Isn't that the problem with all of Magalan?|disdainful
INFO_IKENI7_00010604|Here squat the Outlaws of Tavar, shit living in shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010603|The Fort. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010602|These people are wallowing in chaos. We should free them from their false path. Or just kill them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010601|The worst of both worlds.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010600|Oh good. Some Outlaws must play at being junior Berserkers.|Disdainful
INFO_IKENI7_00010599|What a waste of the planet's surface it is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010598|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010597|The sea.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010596|The pulse in my heart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010594|From the ground shall come Elex.|An addict speaks
INFO_IKENI7_00010592|If Old World technology was as good as they say, they wouldn't have needed a big light to avoid crashing into a cliff.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010591|Perhaps there will be useful equipment here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010590|That's what it looks like.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010589|An old military base.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010588|They couldn't even keep this thing alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010587|The Berserkers think they can bring life to Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010586|Are we going to spend all our time in ruins?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010585|You were bolder than that once Jax. The Free People are at war with themselves. Kill their leaders and they would crumble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010584|Xacor doesn't have enough troops for that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010583|We wouldn't need these defenses if Xacor acted to defeat the Free People.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010582|A Cleric named Xander gave it to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010581|He did? Then you must have his trust.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00010580|Rat gave it to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010579|Then it is preordained.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010578|So, you want me to keep your secret?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010577|I want you to keep our community together. We must stay together if the Albs are to be defeated.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010575|If others discover on their own then what they do with the secret will be their own choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010574|You don't have to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010573|I can't worship a god that is a lie.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010572|Remember, the search for Calaan is the search for our own identity.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010570|Speak the words, keep the secret and help our cause.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010569|What if more people find out about his secret?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010568|And, that strength is what has held back the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010567|Calaan gives people strength.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010566|Look around you. Look what we have created with our faith in him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010565|But, with time I recognized that we do not need a God to make his cause a reality.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010564|And, when I found the truth, I was ready to despair.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010563|I was minded just as you are when I began my own search for Calaan many years ago.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010562|I wasn't born with this knowledge. I learned it during my time studying in the Archives. The conversation you are having with me, I had with a Judicator that came before me. I have kept the secret.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010561|No, taking that from them would be more than cruel. It would risk the whole future of our world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010560|And, take from them the last thing keeping them alive? Tear away the foundation of their faith? The faith is more than the symbol. It is the cause we fight for. The knowledge we have saved. They must be preserved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010559|The people have a right to learn the truth.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010558|A symbol that became hope. For Calaan is that, hope. He is the future the last symbol of the Old World that we have to cling to. That hope must live on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010557|But, at a time of desperation, as fire surged over our planet and threatened to consume all...it became a symbol.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010556|Each has stayed silent and for good reason. Calaan may have only been a piece of soulless metal in the beginning.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010555|How long have you known the truth about Calaan? |
INFO_IKENI7_00010554|Others have traced the truth behind Arvid's teachings before you, before today.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010553|This is not the first time I have had this conversation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010552|But, for one of our own to say such things...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010551|If you weren't one of us, I would have left you with a few words of warning.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010550|Leave, before your heresy lands you in real trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010549|I suppose you have taken too many of the chems that swill round that Fort of yours, Outlaw.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010548|Leave, Berserker, before your heresy lands you in real trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010547|I suppose we should all worship your plants should we?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010546|Who will stand between the Albs and Magalan if the Clerics were to fall?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010545|And, you should ask yourself who would benefit most from problems in the Hort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010544|Our people recognize the greatness Calaan, they know the importance of the work done in his name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010543|No Cleric would put faith in you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010542|If you are planning on spreading this blasphemy among our people, you will fail.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010541|I thought you worshipped knowledge. Calaan is a rocket, that is a fact.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010540|What nonsense is this? Have you lost your mind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010539|Only an outsider would believe something as ridiculous as that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010538|Calaan is no God. You are worshipping an Old World rocket.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010537|What are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010536|I know the secret of Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010535|We're on to something here. I can feel it. You're going to find the answer to questions people have been asking for centuries.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010534|I would come with you, but my duties won't let me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010533|A map? Well? Then find the place that is marked on it!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010532|Yes, a map.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010531|I am certain if you follow this you will find more clues as to the true meaning of Arvid's teachings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010530|I told you that I will come find you if I discover anything interesting.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010529|Don't you remember? The book that you got for me from the Archives?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010528|Exactly!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010527|You mean the book from the Archives?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010526|What are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010525|Please leave me alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010524|You had better go now. If someone hears us then there is nothing that can save us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010523|Our entire society would fall apart and the consequences would be inconceivable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010522|I don't want to believe it. but if what you are saying is true, then it must remain a secret!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010521|Good luck figuring it out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010520|It's good I ran into you!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010519|What else can you tell me about Arvid's teachings?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010518|Did you discover anything else?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010517|But, we're going to need more clues to figure this out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010516|Yes...That looks like another part of our puzzle..|Examining the ?
INFO_IKENI7_00010515|Here, take a look at this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010514|And, what did you find out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010513|I followed the coordinates from Arvid's teachings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010511|Calaan is with us. Whatever you say, the teachings have saved people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010510|Maybe, I can find the answer in prayer. Calaan will not let me down.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010507|Arvid created the religion. He took the name and used it to give people hope.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010506|That can't be! Why would people worship a rocket?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010505|It's the truth. Calaan was the name of a rocket. It was built to save people from the Comet. It's a relic from the Old World.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010504|People get killed for saying crazy things like that!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010503|What are you saying? That's blasphemy!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010501|Right, right, but I promise you, even if you don't want to tell me, I will find out for myself sooner, or later. After all, I'm part of getting you this far.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010500|Trust me. I know that it's difficult for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010499|Too dangerous...? What are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010498|I did, but it would be too dangerous to let you in on the secret. It's for the best.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010496|That can't be. You must have stumbled upon something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010495|Nothing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010494|Calaan is a lie.|Plus three cold
INFO_IKENI7_00010493|Don't keep me in suspense. what did you find out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010492|I can see it in your eyes. You figured out the puzzle.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010491|I wasn't able to decipher the code. But, I am sure you will manage it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010490|So, we know where we need to get into, but not how we can get into it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010489|But...there is one last obstacle. The location that's mentioned in the papers seems to be secured with a code.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010488|You said that you know where you have to search. If your coordinates match mine then you are as good as there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010487|I've transmitted the coordinates to your adjutor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010486|Hm, that was a bit more difficult than I expected, but I think I now know where our search will end.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010485|Let me look through this stuff and see what I can find...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010484|I won't take long, I promise.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010483|But, let me have a look at the documents and see if we've got the right answer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010482|You are really unbelievable!|Excited
INFO_IKENI7_00010481|Then let me help you, after all you've already done a lot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010480|I haven't had time to follow the clues.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010479|I have an idea of where the next clue might be buried.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010478|Were you able to decode the pattern?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010476|Wow, unbelievable, you must have covered quite a distance for that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010475|Did you find any more information?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010474|Yes, I collected all the information I could find.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010473|As I said, find all the information you can. I can't do anything for you before that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010472|I need more information before I can figure this puzzle out. Let me know when you find it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010471|Nothing at the moment. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010469|Come back to me if you find something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010468|Find this place and look around for any written documents.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010464|I was able to decipher the notes and find these coordinates.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010463|I think we should follow the information the notes in the margins give us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010462|Whoever it was, they were trying to solve a riddle.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010461|What's more, someone else must have felt the same and they left a few notes in the margins.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010460|The book is....hard to figure out, but something doesn't feel right about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010458|I burned the midnight oil all night with Arvid's teachings after you got them to me and it paid off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010453|It only takes one wrong person to recognize you and you'll be dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010452|If you are seeking protection among the Free People, your past will have made you a marked man to both sides.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010451|But, you are now free from Elex. And from the orders the come from the heart of Xacor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010449|Beware of the Elexetors and all their lies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010448|As long as my weapons promote fighting among the Free People. The more they kill of each other, the less of a threat they are to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010447|It is an opportunity.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010446|Why are you supplying her with weapons?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010444|No. But, given her situation, it is unlikely that she will try to betray me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010443|Do you trust Paige?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010442|Calaan watch over you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010441|If needs be, we should kill him to convince the others.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010440|Then prove it and assist me in getting this farmer on side.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010439|Of course. Calaan be praised.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010438|Calaan be with you!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010437|I will leave, for now. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010436|But, it appears that without the council of the Judicators, we are at a stalemate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010435|I don't think you really understand what I'm saying here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010434|That isn't Calaan's will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010433|But, as a sworn Cleric, how can you stand against me? We are both fighting for Calaan's just cause.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010432|And now I am wondering what one of our own is doing here without my knowledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010431|You had your reasons. So, you get some reward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010430|Well, if you would help, that would good. That is what I hope this place can be, somewhere for all to work together.|Considering the player
INFO_IKENI7_00010429|I don't want a farm.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010428|A Cleric offering help? What is that going to cost me, my whole farm?|Wary
INFO_IKENI7_00010427|The Hort offers safety to all of us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010426|Here, take it back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010425|We do need these mechs if we are going to keep this city secure. Well, I suppose that's it. I have nothing more for you, so, you should be on your way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010424|I hope this loss won't have any consequences for us in the short term.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010423|Difficulties? Your mission was a failure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010422|There were some difficulties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010421|I know. I can see why you need those mechs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010420|Those bastards!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010419|Your own people attacked you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010418|I was robbed by Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010417|Why? What? What went wrong?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010416|No, it didn't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010415|Here you are again. Did everything go as planned?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010413|Get out of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010412|Let me tell you something right now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010411|Give people some respect and you won't need to fight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010410|Stupid settlers, not even in a Faction.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010409|What are you my mother? You do look like her. But she could hit harder.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010408|What the fuck do you care?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010407|But, I have no idea what the issue is there. You might be able to fix it at the bottom, but there's a chance you will have to climb the antenna mast.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010406|Good, thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010405|You can count on me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010404|Maybe this will refresh your memory.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010403|Are you sure? Completely sure that he didn't say anything useful?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010402|He must have said something about their plans?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010400|I need information about what the Clerics are planning.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010399|No, I don't want you to put me to sleep.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010398|He didn't say anything that would interest you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010397|I assume you don't want to hear about the energy regulators?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010396|I pay. That much you can be sure of.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010395|Enough. The Duke is generous.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010394|How many shards are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010393|I can't, I'm under orders. But, you...you spend a bit more time here, take a good look at the Clerics, I think you'll soon see you don't want to be help them out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010392|Good, and while you're thinking about it, imagine what you can spend the shards on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010391|I'm thinking about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010390|Forget it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010389|That sounds much better.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010388|'Against' is such an ugly word. Let's just say, you are working 'for' filling your pockets with shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010387|I won't work against the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010386|Pretty much nothing, so far. They've not been very loose lipped around me. I must sort of stand out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010385|What information have you gathered about the Clerics?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010384|And, with your abilities, that shouldn't be difficult for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010383|First though, I'm expecting you to bring me a report from one of the other cities.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010382|So, be it the Outlaws, a trip to the Domed City in Abessa, or word from the Clerics in Ignadon, I need information. Bring me a report from at least two cities.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010381|Get them, and you'll be allowed to join.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010380|I told you that I need that information.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010379|Are you going to get me the report I asked for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010378|So don't stand around and waste my time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010377|Thank you for your report.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010376|At least they seem to have recognized who their real enemy is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010375|Their attention is focused largely on the Albs, but they haven't forgotten the other factions. I think their main concern is being attacked if they decide to take on the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010374|I had heard that they were recruiting. How are their forces distributed?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010373|They're prepared, well disciplined and they're developing new weaponry. But, they are short on manpower.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010372|So, tell me about their strength.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010370|The Hort, stronghold of our old enemy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010369|Thank you for your report.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010368|They have similar numbers of people to you. It's true that they don't all agree, but their leader, the Duke, seems to have the Outlaws under control.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010367|And their state of mind? I'd hoped the Outlaw problem would solve itself by them tearing themselves apart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010366|Tavar is always safer when it's fighting itself, it leaves them less energy for fighting us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010365|Then, I will need to think again about Tavar. I was hoping that they'd implode leaving us with one less threat, but it seems we may not be so fortunate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010364|The Fort is well prepared for defense. They're not lacking weapons and they seem determined to keep what they have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010363|We don't trust the secrets of our magic to just anyone. If you want such rewards you need to earn them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010362|Impress me and you will earn not just Elexit, but favor, promotion, honor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010361|Thank you for your report.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010360|The war has displaced a lot of refugees into Abessa, and there's a lot of argument over what do with them and what they mean. That takes up most of their time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010359|I think they're short of supplies and feeling lost, leaderless. Awaiting the axe to fall.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010358|The people in the Domed City seem to want to remain neutral. But, they are waiting to be attacked by the Albs, they know the war is coming.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010357|Any information about the other Factions is useful. Tell me what you learned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010356|Good, then tell me your report on the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010355|I visited the Hort in Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010354|I went to the Domed City in Abessa.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010353|I went to the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010352|Yes, which city did you go to?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010351|I have brought you a report from another city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010349|So, what will it be? Will you prove yourself?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010347|The journey will have dangers, but if you stick to the path you should reach the other cities alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010346|Now, I can give this job to someone else if you would prefer? But, then you would be passing up the chance to prove yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010345|You, on the other hand, might get some proper answers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010344|Sending a Berserker might get the other Factions worried. Or, they simply might not talk to one of us, or worse, talk but lie.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010343|Plus, you aren't one of us, so you can blend in better with the other people. So if you want to join us get going.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010342|You know your way around the wastelands, you've survived out there, so you have the skills I need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010340|Why don't you send one of your people?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010339|That's a lot to ask.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010338|Any information would be useful, but if you could bring me a report from the Fort in Tavar, that would be very useful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010337|I need information about the other factions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010336|If we are going to survive and prosper, if we are to stand a chance against the Albs, I need to know what's going on there. That's where you come in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010335|You must have sensed it out there? That things are changing? That something is happening?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010333|Correct. Then listen well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010332|You said something about a special job if I want to join you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010331|And, if you are planning to join us, then I will have a very special task for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010330|A lot of people come to me, looking to join us, to climb the ranks. You look like you have ambition. If you earn my trust, you'll go far here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010328|I wouldn't go knocking on his door unless you're serious about joining us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010327|They'll check you're not an Alb spy.|An attempt at menace
INFO_IKENI7_00010326|All right, now listen up.|Realising he needs to be more overt
INFO_IKENI7_00010324|It's in the wall facing the outside. You'll find the hatch there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010323|That key fits a mechanism located on the eastern side of the inner castle.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010322|All I can say is that 'news spreads pretty fast in the city. Especially the kind that comes from underground'.|Playing it all very hush hush
INFO_IKENI7_00010321|Then have yourself a drink and sleep on it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010320|You will see when you find the meaning.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010319|Why are you making such a secret of it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010318|I don't understand what you mean.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010317|Pass this test and the secret will open to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010316|Search out its meaning and it will benefit you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010315|Any more I cannot say. The mystery is key to this gift.|Grand, mysterious
INFO_IKENI7_00010314|I don't understand, why have you given this to me?|Confused by the key
INFO_IKENI7_00010313|What do you expect me to do with this key?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010311|Here, my thanks to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010310|Let me know if I can do something for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010309|You just have to ignore them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010308|Ah, forget that guy. Every city has someone like him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010307|I heard about your fight with Brabak.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010306|When you do, make sure you bring some shards. I am sick of giving credit and I need the change, all right?|Cocky, unmoved
INFO_IKENI7_00010305|This isn't over. I will come back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010304|Get lost, you assholes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010303|Why did I think I could trust you? It's obvious that you really don't understand profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010302|Just get out of here, go on...just go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010301|Why did I think I could trust a Cleric? Faith over logic, you really don't understand profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010300|Well, with that tone, I can imagine what happened.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00010299|I gave the weapons to Alois.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010298|You can forget it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010297|Do you have my delivery?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010295|Right. Trust you, sure, sure...Now, that I think about, you do look trustworthy.|Falling under the hypnotic suggestion
INFO_IKENI7_00010294|You don't need a payment, you will just trust me.|Using the force/hypnotising Paige
INFO_IKENI7_00010293|Pay me and I will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010292|You can trust me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010289|Do you really think you can trust the Separatists?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010288|Don't worry, you'll get enough back as payment if you complete the deal to offset your deposit. How does that sound?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010287|Well, need makes strange bed fellows, but...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010286|I'd say you're walking a dangerous line.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010285|And without any guns to show it's just your word against mine and even Alois isn't going to see that as justice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010283|I can't leave without profit. Hell, right now, I can't eat without profit. So, I need this deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010282|So, if you blab, what have I lost? Nothing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010281|Can't you see I'm a victim here? This city is supposed to be neutral, not an enclave of the Hort. So, where's the neutrality if only one side has guns?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010279|Spoken like a true Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010277|Yeah, yeah. Don't tell me 'trading weapons can pose a danger to the community'.|Used to hearing this argument
INFO_IKENI7_00010276|But, what else is a business woman supposed to do when she has her business taken from her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010275|Now they say I'm causing trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010274|Seeing as the Clerics have got picky about who comes in and goes out of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010273|It's impossible to get by the guards without an ID card.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010272|Better armed is better prepared, you mark my words.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010270|The Warlords won't like that when they hear it. If he ever comes back he'll be exiled...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010269|I miss the taverns in Goliet at times like these. I could wash down my troubles there, but...fuck it....he's really gone?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010268|I know I asked you not to get involved, but, I'm glad you did.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010267|You are so wrong.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010266|You think because you beat me once that I'm afraid of you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010265|I am still alive, so I won't hold a grudge. It's good of you to have apologized.|Sour
INFO_IKENI7_00010264|But... |Sour
INFO_IKENI7_00010263|It would've been better if you'd realized that before you attacked me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010262|Yes, I'm sorry. I was wrong to attack you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010261|Then go back to that asshole Brabak and leave me alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010260|No, why?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010259|Did you come to apologize?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010258|But, you gave me your word.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010257|I'll pay anyone who will help me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010255|I'm sure he wants you to hurt me just for his pleasure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010254|About Brabak...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010253|If you ignore anything else, don't ignore that advice. Don't piss off the Clerics. There now you are fully informed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010252|He thinks he's his god's messenger, or something. And that means he's got one big, old stick up his ass. So, don't piss him off. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010251|Alois, he runs this place and he hates thieves. And beggars. And trouble causers. And pretty much anyone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010250|The southern part, well, that is really quiet, nothing really happens there. But, wherever you are, you should know the Clerics are watching.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010249|The westerns section's safer. You're okay there so long as you don't break the law, or look funny, or say something the Clerics don't like.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010248|This place always has something going on, but right now there's really something brewing. That means the north isn't exactly welcoming unless you're a thug.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010247|Right, well, where to start...? First off a lot of people are avoiding the north of the city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010246|Tell me about the city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010245|What? Don't look at me like that, you try living my life.|Defensive, down
INFO_IKENI7_00010244|One shard, two shards, you'd think people could spare that wouldn't you?|Bitter
INFO_IKENI7_00010243|So, that's all I could get, okay? That's the end of it. Kill me, or don't, but that's all I can give you.|Desperate
INFO_IKENI7_00010242|Since then I've not been able to get enough to eat, let alone to give you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010241|A whole bunch of guys beat the living crap out of me and told me not to come round here again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010240|Here. And that's all I can get. And I mean all, forever.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010239|I can't give you anything if you don't give me time to earn it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010238|You are too early.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010237|I told you, I need a week. A week, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010236|Of course, here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010235|Here, this is all I have. That's all I could get this week.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010234|Time to pay up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010233|See you in a week's time, all right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010232|All right, all right, come by once a week and I will give you what I can get. But don't expect much. It's not often a sap like you comes along. No offense.|Giving in.
INFO_IKENI7_00010231|Then that's how it is?|Down
INFO_IKENI7_00010230|No. You're going to replace every shard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010229|You're right, I'm not worth it. You're doing the right thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010228|You're not worth the trouble. Get out of here!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010227|Really. If I had more, I wouldn't be pulling stunts like this one would I?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010226|Here, that is everything I have. Take it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010225|Okay, no problem!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010224|All that I want is the chance for a new beginning. To put all this stuff behind me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010223|Can't you just let me go? I won't cause you any more problems!|Pleading
INFO_IKENI7_00010222|You're good at conning shards out of people, so you can go and con some shards for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010221|Then give me what you have got and give it to me now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010220|Nobody on the whole of Magalan knows where his hideout is. Not even the Duke of Tavar can find him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010219|Just give me my shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010218|I just want you to know they forced me to con you, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010217|Yeah, yeah, your shards, okay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010215|Bloody Baxter has them now, you won't see them again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010214|I can't, they're gone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010213|I'm not giving it away. I want my shards back. Now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010212|You... Fuck it, if you can fight like that, why are you giving your money away?|Breathless, annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00010211|Oh, wait don't tell me. You went and brought the sap here didn't you?|Realising who it is
INFO_IKENI7_00010210|You know, you should've just paid. Now, we'll have to kill you and take the money.|To the player
INFO_IKENI7_00010207|You dipshit...get out of here, go on, go back to your begging, we'll deal with this.|To the beggar
INFO_IKENI7_00010206|He threatened me. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010205|Hey! Who the hell is this? I told you to come alone. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010204|Right, I don't suppose I have a choice do I? All right. Follow me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010202|You'll be safe with me, just take me there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010201|I'll kill you if you don't take me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010199|Hey, no, those guys are dangerous. If I just show up there with you they'll kill me!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010198|Take me to your people so I can sort this out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010197|Okay, right. Sorry, I'm going. I'm gone. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010196|One more word and you're dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010195|Okay. But, are you sure? I mean, this armor is something really special.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010194|Forget it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010193|So, they're saying the purchase price has now risen to ten thousand shards. But, it is an investment, I mean otherwise why would that other person want it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010192|Well, you see it turns out that there is another interested party and he offered the guys a lot more than you did.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010191|No more excuses. I want the armor I paid you for.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010190|You see the thing is...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010189|Wellll, sooooo, there were a few difficulties.|Making excuses
INFO_IKENI7_00010188|Have you got the armor I paid for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010187|See you tomorrow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010186|All right. I will need a few hours to get business moving along and I'll get back to you with an update.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010185|There is no reason to be mistrustful, this is a sure-fire thing!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010184|No, you're not getting any more money from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010183|All right, but you'd better not be ripping me off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010182|Now, I'm not supposed to taddle-piddle, but I hear you have put your money into some new armor prototype or something, I don't know exactly what it is.|Getting tittle tattle (slang for gossip) wrong. Vestment getting investment wrong.
INFO_IKENI7_00010181|But, I thought I'd better tell you that much as, well they've asked me to get another advance payment from you ahead of delivery. I know it's extra, but it will be worth it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010180|I have good news! Your money is at work. It's been invigorated in the project and it will pay you back many fold.|invigorated instead of invested
INFO_IKENI7_00010179|There you are!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010178|And, I said, I'd trust them with my life, yeah? Yeah? No. Okay. I'll tell them no.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010177|Well, some opportunities only present themselves once.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010176|No. No. Really, you're right to trust these guys. Come back tomorrow, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010175|I'm not interested.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010174|Alright. But, don't try and cheat me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010173|Oh, don't get caught up in details, just know that the they're absolutely fantastic people. But, they do have trust issues. Hence the secrecy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010172|Who are they, and what would I be investing in?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010171|Don't worry, they are spectacular people. I'd trust them with my life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010170|You expect me to trust you with Elexit? Without you telling me what I'm paying for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010169|But, then if I had the shards I wouldn't eat cardboard to stop feeling hungry would I? But, really, give them the shards. They'll make you rich.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010167|They can offer you more than information, But, you'll need to put some shards up first. Trust me, if I had the shards, I'd invest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010166|So, could you help some friends of mine?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010165|Ah, here you are now. I've not forgotten your philan..philan.. philandering nature. Charity counts.|Getting philanthtopic wrong
INFO_IKENI7_00010164|Come back in a few days yeah, I'll have something that might interest you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010163|And, since you have helped me, I'll make sure my contacts hear about it. You help me, I'll help you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010162|Thanks, thank you. I won't forget this.|Pleased.
INFO_IKENI7_00010159|There, take this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010158|Get out of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010157|Help me out and I'll tell you about the city. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010156|Hey, have you got a few shards for a veteran?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010155|All right, all right. Just this once. And, this is a final offer, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010154|Cut the price, or no deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010153|Trade means us both profiting, right? So, buy, or don't buy, that's the price.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010152|I'm asking what it's worth.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010151|You're asking too much for that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010150|Anyone making trouble with me now will regret it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010149|Well, I'll do you a deal, but nothing's free now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010148|Well, that's your business. I'll get on with it now.|Agreeing
INFO_IKENI7_00010147|Sure, I'll deal with you, if the price is right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010146|No, I don't want to trade with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010145|Just one more term, then I can retire.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010144|Too many of you desert dwellers forget that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010143|Are you going to show me that you are the exception?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010142|If she tries to get you involved in this business, then do the only thing that is right and bring me what she wants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010141|But, if my information is right then she has found herself a new source and is trying to acquire some as we speak.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010140|We've suspected her for some time now, but we've yet to catch her with any shipments of weapons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010139|So, you met Paige?|Revealing that he already knows
INFO_IKENI7_00010138|I know who is trying to smuggle weapons into the Domed City.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010137|And, in the meantime, I'll find a good home for Snuffles.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010136|Well, believe it or not, I'm a Cleric now. Never saw that coming in life.|Surprised at this turn of events
INFO_IKENI7_00010135|You're a Cleric, aren't you? Maybe, it's that Calaan of yours...Does Calaan give you protection against spirits? He must give you protection against Outlaws if you've got this far.|Thinking it through
INFO_IKENI7_00010134|Maybe this is the peace token we needed and we can set up a proper trading agreement with them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010133|Good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010132|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010131|Anything to make life easier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010130|Thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010129|Well, if you suddenly find yourself struck down with humility, you know where to find me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010128|The scriptures. The writings. The texts. The foundations of our faith and Old World manuals that support our technology.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010127|Until you understand that only authorized personnel may enter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010126|How many times are you going to repeat that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010125|That's all the reason I need. That's all I have to say.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010124|Anything is better than spilling blood for profit. That just means the people who send you to do it have put a price on your life.|Stress on your
INFO_IKENI7_00010123|The wrong friends, the wrong goals, the wrong life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010122|The past?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010121|To escape the past.|Reflecting
INFO_IKENI7_00010120|Why did you come to Ignadon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010119|This is a miserable place to have decided to give up smoking...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010118|Sleep, relax. Dream of freedom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010117|You can use the beds in our storeroom any time you want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010115|You, my friend, will survive. You, my friend, realize the power of rest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010113|And, when you get rest, don't just go sleeping on rocks, that's no good at all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010112|Don't forget to rest, your body won't forgive that for long.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010111|But, you need to get some sleep, I can see that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010110|Sure, why not?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010109|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010108|Are you looking for a place to stay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010107|This freedom is fucking hard work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010106|I smell like a dead troll I've sweated so much.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010105|Well, you've been walking round for awhile now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010104|Take care of yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010103|Truth is, it's fucking dangerous out here. The reavers are bad enough, but these chimeras...|Aside
INFO_IKENI7_00010102|You're not denying it...so, that means you'll have to pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010101|Who told you my business was good?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010100|So, don't waste your time worrying about him.|Certain
INFO_IKENI7_00010099|Most of the prisoners want to escape, but he's not going to get away from the Suggestors. |Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00010098|Your prisoner Eli, do you think he wants to escape?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010097|And, you will have to live with your conscience.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010096|And, now he's protected, you can be sure Suggestor Balder will be keeping an eye on him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010095|He should be dead and not here in our midst.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010094|Eli has been suggested.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010093|Come back when you've reconsidered.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010092|Then you'll be asking me for help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010091|Wait until they try and do to you what they've done to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010090|Yeah, you say that now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010089|I've got no reason to help you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010088|Get out of here, we have nothing to say to each other.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010087|And, that someone needs to be you. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010086|Someone needs to put that animal down.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010085|Then you've done nothing! They'll let him go and then there'll be real trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010084|I left Eli as a prisoner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010083|I'll see you then, and at that point you might as well be an Alb.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010082|Cos, that's what you'll have when they get hold of you -shit...for...brains. You'll go and fight for them, or just sit in a corner and dribble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010081|Sure, right, shit for brains.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010080|As far as I'm concerned, you can rot here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010079|I thought that was clear?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010078|I need you to do that. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010077|Hold on a moment. I can't kill him. Look at me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010076|No, he is waiting for you in front of the gate just as you asked.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010075|Free? You mean he escaped?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010074|Eli is free.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010073|I've spoken to him, he doesn't remember a damn thing about me, or where he came from.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010071|Anyway, they wouldn't listen. They dragged me here and tried to brainwash me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010070|But, their bullshit didn't take, I remembered everything, and so, instead of setting me free, they dropped me down here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010069|Total bullshit, what do they think I am, suicidal?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010068|They said we attacked one of their outposts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010067|How did you end up here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010066|But, you know, I get by, all in all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010065|I have to work part-time as a miner, just to keep going.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010064|Define 'many'. Ignadon isn't exactly the center of commerce on Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010063|Do you have many customers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010062|You should stay well away from him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010061|Of course, he isn't exactly timid about approaching people. The xenophobic imbecile wants people dead and he is looking to recruit anyone who'll listen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010060|Wait, you know about his plan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010059|I just hope I can get through to him before he gets someone to help him with his plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010058|Yes, I had a message from him insisting that Eli was 'beyond saving', but Suggestion will win out. He can' resist it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010057|Wolf wants Eli dead. He asked me to kill him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010056|I'm sorry to put you in this position, but the words have been said. Now, you have to choose if you'll help me. I've put my trust in you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010055|But, that does mean if you leave him and he kills someone then that blood will be on your hands. Could you live with that as a Cleric?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010053|I know it's a lot to ask, but...well, yes, it's your choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010052|And, believe me, telling the Suggestors something would doom me, but it would also get them paying attention to you. Think on that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010051|If you need a better persuasion, sure I'll pay you if you get the job done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010050|Nothing but your conscience.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010049|What's to stop me telling someone you're planning to murder someone?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010048|And, you want me to do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010047|He needs to be taken care of before he kills people we do need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010046|They're going to let him out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010045|Because, he won't be a prisoner for life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010044|How can a prisoner be a threat?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010043|It's hard wired into him. They aren't going to erase that with Suggestion. He is going to blow and they will have put a weapon in his hand when he does.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010042|I saw it in his eyes. There was nothing, but blank hate there. I don't care how strong those Suggestors think they are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010041|Why do you think that he's dangerous?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010039|Or, have you come to learn the benefits of progress?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010037|It was a warning.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010036|What? No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010035|Just be careful, all right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010034|Was that a threat?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010033|Yes! Those rocks weigh a hell of a lot, meaning if they fall there won't be a hell of a lot left of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010032|Otherwise, you'll end up squashed flatter than an Alb's conscience.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010031|You think I should be afraid of a few rocks?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010030|And, tell them I want answers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010029|And, if you've found one set, can you find these assholes too?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010028|That's good to hear, but we're talking about a different set of criminals. |
INFO_IKENI7_00010027|I have already found the Chem dealers for Reinhold.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010026|But, whoever it is, I want these bastards dealt with.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010025|Glad to help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010024|But, hey, he has to move at some point doesn't he?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010023|But, then I guess that's why I keep getting in trouble. So...are you going to help me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010022|Unless you just believe what people say they mean...|
INFO_IKENI7_00010021|Yes, no, who knows. I mean some of those texts are hard to work out. |Thinking it through, trying to remember
INFO_IKENI7_00010020|Does Calaan approve of betting?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010018|Ach, who is talking about trouble? It's a trivial matter, really.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010017|I don't want any trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010016|Always listen to your heart!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010014|No, no. You can't force people to change who they are. You can only bring out their...better traits.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010013|Good. Anything else would be foolish of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010011|There are many things I believe in, refunds aren't one of them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010010|I can live with that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010009|I think I'll stay, until I get my shards back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010008|You're here to do a job, so I'll give you the tools you need to do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010007|Thanks, I'll see you when you get back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010006|Good luck, we need those parts!|
INFO_IKENI7_00010005|You'll trust me with your shards, just like that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00010004|No problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00010003|But, it seems not even our magic helps us keep up with supplies.|Wishful
INFO_IKENI7_00010001|Even if our magic can protect us from what is out there, it is no replacement for a full stomach.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009999|So, the Albs pump Elex into themselves, the Clerics feed it to machines and we transmute it...into magic!|Selling his ideal
INFO_IKENI7_00009998|And if you have magic, why would you want technology?|Rhetorical
INFO_IKENI7_00009996|In any case, I won't let myself be deceived.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009995|People like you are only interested in the power that comes from magic, not the problems of common folk.|Used to being ignored
INFO_IKENI7_00009993|Don't pretend like you feel sorry for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009991|It doesn't sound like you're getting the help you deserve.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009989|But, then what does magic do for me when I am hungry?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009988|Work here might be quite hard, physical labor, but it's supposed to be balanced out with magic. But, where is the help that I need?|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00009986|Mana, spells, magic it up, whatever you want to call it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009985|Magic up supplies?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009984|They are supposed to be able to conjure stuff up with their magic, but can they do that with supplies? Can they magic up the food we need? No, they can't.|The word "magic" should be emphasised here. She looks down on magic.
INFO_IKENI7_00009982|Unless you have official business here, please move along.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009981|There's a lot of difference between theory in the Hort and fighting our enemies out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009980|But, really we're a training base. Initiates are posted out here to finish their training.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009979|In theory we are here to control the border, when we get chance between reaver attacks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009978|What is the purpose of this outpost?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009977|That said...we are short of Elexit out here. If you're willing to pay, I could share some of my knowledge with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009976|I'm not an instructor, I'm here to show Initiates the real world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009975|If you train Initiates, can you teach me something?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009974|The Clerics are the last defense against the Albs and we shall hold true.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009973|You are safe from the Albs here, in any case.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009971|There are other rules out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009970|Poor bastard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009969|If we all came together we could sort it out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009968|Maybe' won't save you when they try and fry your mind like they tried with me!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009967|Maybe? What's maybe? This is a world of action.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009966|So, will you help me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009964|Next you will send me someone who can't even recognize a screwdriver.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009963|So, talk to them and see if you can make it an ongoing arrangement.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009962|Do you think that's you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009960|Because, I want this done diplomatically, to organize something we can keep going in the future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009959|No. I came here to get away from people who think like that. We need trade, not theft and murder..|
INFO_IKENI7_00009958|That means finding someone who understands the people out there as well as those in here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009957|Why haven't you started trading already?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009956|If you need the food. Take it from them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009954|You get what you pay for. Good equipment is expensive.|Sales
INFO_IKENI7_00009953|Watch yourself round here. None of us want any more rockslides.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009952|I've got to get back at it. I'm reckoning you're not that into ore extraction techniques anyway.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009951|But, don't let me keep you with all my chatter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009950|A dead Outlaw is rarely cause for pity around here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009949|Instruction. Education. A preparation for readiness.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009948|Initiation?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009947|Mine and my brother's shack. We share everything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009946|Don't let us down, Outlaw.|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00009945|Get him back to me alive and I will make sure you get paid properly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009944|Free People? I don't know a single person that's free. But, I admire your ideals. And, Frank certainly needs to believe in freedom.|Doubtful
INFO_IKENI7_00009943|We're all Free People, we should fight together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009942|Then you'll have your shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009941|Shards will buy you loyalty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009940|If I don't want to end up back in here with a different jailer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009939|I'm not telling you a thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009938|You got lucky once, don't hope for twice.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00009937|You tried, you lost, get over it.|Gloating
INFO_IKENI7_00009936|Or, are you all talk? Come on, get the drink, take the deal. The future is waiting for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009935|And, you're a cocky son of a bitch.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009933|Like to talk big, don't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009932|Is that so?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009931|Some day, someone is going to take his place. And, when they do, you'll want them to be a friend of yours.|Meaning himself
INFO_IKENI7_00009929|Get me a drink. Get me some food.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009928|And, something to eat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009926|You should start listening to people in the know, or you are going to get left behind. |Hollow threat
INFO_IKENI7_00009923|Defeating Baxter doesn't make him immortal. The Duke might have the Fort now, but remember! No one thought Baxter could be overthrown and where is Baxter now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009922|Or, do you think you've got connections you think will save you from that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009921|Doing that would be a good move on your part. You'll want me to owe you a favor when all my plans come together.|Swaggering
INFO_IKENI7_00009920|Are you on chems, or just dumb?|Playing the big man
INFO_IKENI7_00009919|No pay, no drink.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009918|You're not getting any shards. Just get your ass moving.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009917|Sure. Pay me and I'll get them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009916|Get them for me now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009915|Do as I say, or I'll shove your head so far up your ass you'll be kissing your own tonsils.|Playing the big man
INFO_IKENI7_00009914|Get it yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009913|Well? What are you waiting for? Go get it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009912|And, not just beans, get me something decent.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009911|That ring any bells? I know that casket was what blew. You and the Scrap Baron, you murdered my brother!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009910|You put that casket in our shack you shit rat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009909|Then why did you kill him?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009908|I don't know your brother.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009907|Now, I'm going to kill you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009906|So, my life matters and his doesn't?! You think I should just take this? No. You killed my brother.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009905|Do you want to end up dead too?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009904|You don't get a choice!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009903|You think I want to talk to you? Piss off.|Angry, disbelief the character has come back.
INFO_IKENI7_00009902|Give it to me and get out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009901|Give it to me. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009900|No. But, neither will your life. Take it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009899|You think this can pay for my brother?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009898|Take this as compensation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009897|I don't have any time for this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009894|Forgot about another - the danger of prying fangs. I'll remember that next time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009893|Get the job done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009891|I'll send the coordinates to your adjutor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009890|This is for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009889|See it as a sign of that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009888|You see? All Free People can work together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009887|Take this as a gesture of our appreciation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009886|I'll get you the stock you need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009885|So, get yourself over there and bring me back whatever stocks you find.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009884|You have a kind and blessed heart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009883|Ha. I like you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009882|I can do that now if you like.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009881|So, what now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009880|Good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009879|All right. I guess it is time for a change. I'll do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009878|Take the Elexit and swear loyalty to the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009877|My boots are rubbing, I could use a little break.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009876|Ach, that can wait.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009875|When are you moving on?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009874|Our drone intelligence suggested that he was one to watch.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009873|And, loyalty should be rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009872|You completed the tasks you were set to our satisfaction.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009871|I am disappointed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009870|You really have failed to live up to your task.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009869|How can you consider your task complete when you failed to bring a single initiate through the gates?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009868|A very satisfactory conclusion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009867|Yes and you brought all of them here safely.|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00009866|I located the initiates.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009865|Don't forget to report to Reinhold.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009864|You asshole!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009863|There's nothing I can do. You'll have to go back to Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009862|You told me to come here!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009861|You mean I travelled here for nothing?!|Getting angry
INFO_IKENI7_00009860|Are you joking? |
INFO_IKENI7_00009859|Do they need me, or not? Make your mind up!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009858|I thought you said I was sent for?|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00009857|Send him in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009856|I'm afraid this is where it ends. Xander recognizes you. There's no way he'll let you in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009855|It's all sorted out now. Go in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009854|Are you sure? It looked like he wanted to kill me.|Wary
INFO_IKENI7_00009853|You brought him here, you will remove him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009852|Then everything has been said on this matter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009851|I'm not paying for him to enter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009850|He's not coming in until the merchant gets paid for the goods that were stolen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009848|Vouch whatever you like.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009847|Who am I to stand in the way of such dutiful action? Conner is free to enter the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009846|Well, you are determined to carry out your orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009845|Hmm. You're right, And, I'll hold you to that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009844|I'm vouching for him. And, if he causes problems, Claw rules, you can kill him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009843|Him? You don't even know him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009842|Take this, that should cover the stolen goods.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009841|What if I vouch for him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009840|I am.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009839|Ah, so you are...?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009838|For stretching your “claws”...|
INFO_IKENI7_00009837|For what?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009836|Say, did I congratulate you yet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009835|Keep it until such time as it is needed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009833|I can't tell you any more about it, but...the meaning will be revealed to you in time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009832|Here, I would like to give you this for the road.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009831|He could work for the Claws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009830|Dead, or alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009825|Get him out of my sight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009824|He's not in the Hort, so, he's not a Initiate, so, I don't have to welcome him. End of story.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009823|But...you're only an Intiate once you're inside the Hort. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009822|I'm not refusing anything. The order says we must seek out and welcome new Initiates.|Innocent
INFO_IKENI7_00009821|And, he's threatened the defense I offer my traders. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009820|That's enough isn't it? He stole from us. Endangered the supplies to the Hort|
INFO_IKENI7_00009819|So the only reason you won't let him in is because of this ambush?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009818|And, if it is him, do we really want someone like that joining the Clerics?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009817|So, you're refusing Balder's order?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009815|I can't prove it, that's why he's still walking round breathing, but I can't let him in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009814|Because, Connor matches the description of a guy who ambushed one of my merchants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009813|Why wouldn't you let Connor into the Hort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009812|It was all a misunderstanding. You can go in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009809|And, Snuffles there will appreciate the meal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009807|Now, I get here and that idiot at the gate won't let me in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009806|I spoke with Xander.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009805|It's your blood you're spilling.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009804|Are you sure you want to do this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009802|You think I'll die that easily?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009801|If you die, you'll be one less enemy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009800|How will hurting me help either of us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009799|I'm not paying. But, I'll force you if I have to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009798|But, what the hell, I'm in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009797|Well, it'll do for now, but I hope there is more where that came from.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009796|That's everything I can offer you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009794|Then, I'm not prepared to accept your offer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009793|I can't pay you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009791|Then you'd better go down to the gate and find out what's going on..|With a sigh
INFO_IKENI7_00009790|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009789|But, they're not letting him into the Hort. He's been stopped at the gate. Have you any explanation for that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009788|I've been told that he's already here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009787|The Initiate 'Connor' should arrive here soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009786|Good, then I will just wait. See you in Ignadon, comrade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009785|They'll take you to the Hort and explain everything to you there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009784|Wait here and you'll be collected.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009783|All right, all right, so what do I do now? When does all this start?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009782|Snuffles can take care of himself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009781|He can look after himself. You...are right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009780|You don't need to worry about him. Your jackal can look after himself.|Hypnotising
INFO_IKENI7_00009779|But, fair enough. I'm in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009778|You must need men if you're prepared to pay that much!|Observation
INFO_IKENI7_00009777|This should be enough to get care for Snuffles without people asking questions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009776|And, I don't want to think what they'd do to him if they find out I've joined the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009775|But, it wouldn't be cheap. They don't do anything for charity.|Concluding
INFO_IKENI7_00009774|I could probably find one of the Duke's men who'd look after him.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00009773|All right, I'm in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009772|But, then as my jackal is dead...I suppose there is nothing to keep me here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009771|And, I won't just abandon him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009770|Well, there's Snuffles for a start. I won't be able to take him with me, will I?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009769|What's there to think about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009768|I'm going to have a think before I make a decision like that. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009767|You think I'll help out just like that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009766|You expect me to offer help to Ignadon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009765|We need help from you. You've been selected by our scouts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009764|I'm here to find suitable recruits to join them. Ignadon needs men as well as machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009763|So, come on, what is their problem? It's obvious you're one of them, so speak up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009762|With what? Supplies? You'd think with their machines they wouldn't need help from anyone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009761|Help? |
INFO_IKENI7_00009760|The Clerics need help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009759|Sorry about the smell, I kept them in my...boots. Still should keep them safe from thieves.|Deciding to admit to boots instead of pants.
INFO_IKENI7_00009758|Here, some shards from my emergency stash.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009756|And, still fresh. Great.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009755|I got the meat you wanted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009754|Take it easy.|Relaxed
INFO_IKENI7_00009753|Do what you want. I'm just telling you want I'll trade.|Relaxed
INFO_IKENI7_00009752|Okay. A half dozen cuts should be enough.|Pleased to be in business
INFO_IKENI7_00009751|You want me to look for pet food?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009750|Sure, I'll get you some meat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009749|Snuffles over there could do with something better to eat than old shoe soles.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009747|Well... if you can get some raw meat I'll trade you something.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00009746|So, there's nothing you want to trade?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009745|Guys who couldn't pay. Guys who bargained over every last shard. I don't want to deal with that sort of shit.|Recollecting
INFO_IKENI7_00009744|I tried it once, but in the end it just brought me trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009743|Sell? No. I'm no good as a trader.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009742|Do you have anything to sell?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009741|That's why I decided to take him with me. Big, daft oaf that he is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009740|In any case, he's harmless. Not like the other beasts round here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009739|When I found him, he was chewing on a sword. Either, his owner had abandoned him, or been killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009738|I didn't, someone else did.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009737|How did you train that jackal?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009736|Right, enough with the talk, I need to feed my mutt.|Signing off.
INFO_IKENI7_00009735|You might as well not go home completely empty handed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009734|And, don't worry, it's clean. Any animal that tries to piss in the well here ends up fried.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009732|Sure, have a look round, see what you find, but I'm telling you, you're wasting your time. This place is cleaned out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009731|Here, take some water.|Relaxed, friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00009730|I got lucky 'cause someone had stashed their finds over there. So, at least I got some reward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009729|A few bits of scrap, a few shards, nothing worth the time I've spend.|Relaxed, friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00009728|And, what did you find?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009727|Hey, I'm just trying to save you some time.|Relaxed, friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00009726|You just want to get rid of me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009725|You'll do better elsewhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009724|So, don't waste your time here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009723|This place has already been picked clean.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009722|I'll save you the trouble of looking around.|Relaxed, friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00009721|Are you still trying to convince me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009720|I will kill you this time!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009719|Good. You won't regret it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009718|Yeah. I'll be ready.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009717|Okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009716|A group will take you to the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009715|You will be collected in a few days.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009714|Okay, okay, I'll join. Better that than die out here.|He's giving in here.
INFO_IKENI7_00009713|Are you serious?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009712|Join, or die. That's your choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009711|What?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009710|Join, or I'll kill you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009709|Okay. But, I'm not saying I'll join. I need to think.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009708|As proof of their intention.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009707|An advance? You mean you'll give me Elexit, just like that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009706|If you need proof, I can give you some Elexit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009705|I'm finishing this job by finishing these jackals.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009704|The Clerics will just do that to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009703|Scrappy is like that because he joined a faction and they screwed him over. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009702|Think about it, they pay well. You're just about surviving here. You don't want to end up like Scrappy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009701|Then you will join the Clerics. You will find a new family in Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009700|A new family. Yes, yes, I want a new family.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009699|You have made good on your promise, it is time to change. It is time to join a new family.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009698|But...my promise.|Fighting the suggestion
INFO_IKENI7_00009697|Your job here is done, it is time to leave. You will join the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009696|I made that promise to my family.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009695|No, I am staying here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009694|Clerics, Outlaws, whatever. They're not for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009693|No, no, I'm not the man for that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009692|The Clerics want you to join them. You'd have training, food, a place to live. You should join.|Sales pitch - recruiting
INFO_IKENI7_00009690|Yeah, sure, I understand.|A beaten man.
INFO_IKENI7_00009689|Just don't give them any trouble, understand?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009688|Once there, you'll begin your training.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009686|A recruitment party will come and collect you, they'll make sure you get to Ignadon safely.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009685|After all that, I just wait?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009684|All you need to do is wait here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009683|Good, fine, whatever, just...don't hurt them, okay? If they're safe, I'll do whatever you ask.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009682|I'm offering you all a chance of safety.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009681|You're threatening them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009680|You wouldn't want anything to happen to them, would you? Join us and they will be safe.|Threatening plus two cold
INFO_IKENI7_00009679|They will be brought to Ignadon later. Calaan will welcome them.|humane minus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00009677|And my family?|Reluctant, but starting to give way.
INFO_IKENI7_00009676|Ignadon is your home now. No exile, no shame from your crime. You will be welcome there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009675|Lucky? I just want to live in peace and go home.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009674|You're lucky it's just a rib.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009673|You broke my rib! |
INFO_IKENI7_00009671|I might have been exiled, but that doesn't mean I'll sell out. I want to go back to Goliet, not Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009670|Do you really want to fight this? The Clerics will offer you a new start.|Having lost - trying to talk Galar round again.
INFO_IKENI7_00009669|I won't let you slip away again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009668|Are you afraid of a fight? Why did you run like that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009667|All I heard about the Clerics' boneheaded stupidity is true...Go back to Calaan, Cleric, you won't make a believer out of me.|Having lost - trying to talk Galar round again.
INFO_IKENI7_00009666|Thank you, I have found safety and purpose here.|A convert
INFO_IKENI7_00009665|You...are right. I am a Cleric.|Succumbing to the power of the player's persuasion skill
INFO_IKENI7_00009664|The Clerics are your family. You will join them and start your life again.|Firm
INFO_IKENI7_00009663|But...|
INFO_IKENI7_00009662|No, you've picked the wrong guy. You're not taking me back to Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009661|I'm a Berserker and I'm no traitor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009660|Last chance, join us, or die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009659|You've had my answer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009658|I'll serve my punishment and return to Goliet when they call me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009657|I can't be bought.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009656|I don't care how many shards you offer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009655|You will be paid well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009654|You'll join the Clerics. Or, I'll bury you here.|Determined
INFO_IKENI7_00009653|This isn't a debate. You will join the Clerics.|Using his suggestion skill.  (think of Obi Wan using the Force)
INFO_IKENI7_00009652|We have to put this planet back to how it was. Not dig more of it up to build machines.|Machines is a dirty word.
INFO_IKENI7_00009651|No, no, no. Technology can only lead to the end of our world. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009650|Are you serious? Become a Cleric, me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009648|I've come here to invite you to Ignadon. To become a Cleric. The Berserkers sent you out here to die, the Clerics offer you salvation.|The player has been sent on a quest to recruit Galar to become a Cleric
INFO_IKENI7_00009647|You have the thanks of the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009645|You have done the Hort a great service. Our ranks must be filled and you have helped to bring new initiates to our cause.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009644|You'll have to do better if you are to progress here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009643|Recruitment is key to our survival and you've lost us potential initiates.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009642|Well, that's the last of the Initiates we'd identified.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009641|I can't say that I'm anything but disappointed. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009640|Good work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009639|He might find that tough, as an Outlaw, but all components must be forged, he will soon fit the role he is to serve.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009638|Excellent.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009637|I'll be interested to see how this Berserker settles into our community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009636|Let us hope he proves his potential.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009635|Good, very good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009634|Rider is ready to start his initiation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009633|Galar has agreed to join us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009632|Connor has arrived for initiation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009631|A sad loss.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009630|Of all the Initiates he appeared to have most potential.|Weary
INFO_IKENI7_00009629|We'll have to speed up initiation before the next Alb offensive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009628|It seems we are losing men before we even have them.|Weary
INFO_IKENI7_00009627|That is a shame, our intelligence suggested he could have been a good initiate. I will make note of this in our records.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009626|Connor is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009625|Rider is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009624|Galar is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009623|About the Initiates you want me to find...|
INFO_IKENI7_00009622|Once you have persuade an intiate to join us, an escort will bring them back to the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009621|I'll transmit their coordinates to your adjutor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009620|The first two should be in Tavar and third man in Edan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009619|Connor, Rider and Galar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009618|I've selected three men that our drones have identified.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009617|We want the brightest and the best, but will settle for the available and the willing. |Inspiring then ruefully realistic
INFO_IKENI7_00009616|Who do you want me to recruit?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009614|Some candidates can be persuaded, but with others, you may need to break their will, or use force to initiate them. I know that may feel wrong, but remember you are saving them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009613|That is why it is so important to recruit new believers into our ranks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009612|Once there, I'd advise you to avoid more densely populated areas. It will be safer, particularly as some of those in the towns have been brainwashed into their cause.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009611|You may have to go deep into enemy territory to find suitable candidates, so make sure you have the right supplies before you leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009610|Your devotion speaks well of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009609|There is no substitution for boots on the ground.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009608|While we constantly strive for improvements to our mechs history has given us bitter lessons to teach us not machines to deliver Calaan's will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009606|Why are you worrying about people when you have mechs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009605|I will do as Calaan instructs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009604|Others will follow our example just as you did.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009603|Good. It is your responsibility to locate new initiates for our order.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009602|That's why I am here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009601|Legate. There is work to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009600|And, I will count this task as completed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009599|You can be sure Martha will be grateful you have made this act of penance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009597|Here, for the good of the community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009596|Then, I hope this task has a lasting effect. All Clerics must learn that they are part of a community. Each individual serves Calaan and through him, Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009595|I will view your service to the community as complete once you have made this offering.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009594|Any donation will be used to alleviate the food shortage we have here, it will show you intend to contribute to this community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009593|I expect you to make a suitable donation in Calaan's honor as penance for this failure..|
INFO_IKENI7_00009590|The task wasn't completed to Martha's satisfaction.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009589|You have. There weren't any difficulties, according to Martha.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009587|It seems that humility and service aren't your strong points.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009586|I have completed Martha's task.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009585|Any deity that can look at this world and see it as a place for the saved...must surely have a sense of humor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009584|Be humble!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009583|Are you still here? Go! Deliver! Don't let the stew get cold!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009582|I hope you are taking the teachings of our community to heart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009581|And, it is good to see you are taking your Acolyte duties so seriously.|Positive Praise
INFO_IKENI7_00009580|Meet me back here later. Your task of humility will await you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009579|Wait, wait, wait! You do take things literally, don't you? One thing Calaan teaches is the need for a sense of humor.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00009578|Then I'll take yours to someone else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009577|Hunger can be tamed with focus and a full stomach only dulls the mind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009576|Are you hungry? I am distributing this stew for Martha.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009575|Listen to Calaan, hear his wisdom and his path will lead you to glory.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009574|Those who make just one mistake are on a road that leads to failure.|Lecturing
INFO_IKENI7_00009573|Calaan rewards his servants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009572|Just as I expected from a loyal servant.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009571|You answered my questions correctly.|Praising
INFO_IKENI7_00009570|So, acolyte...|
INFO_IKENI7_00009569|No. Berengar was my father's name, and he was anything but a prophet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009568|I am surprised. Most acolytes don't apply themselves to their task this diligently.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009567|No. You will have to study harder.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009566|Berengar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009565|Arvid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009564|Sigmund.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009563|What is the name of our Prophet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009562|I have one last question.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009561|No, and if you had engaged your brain you would have known that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009560|However, your answer is correct.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009558|Judicator Ulbricht.|Stressing his rank - Judicator
INFO_IKENI7_00009557|Just because Judicator Reinhold is in charge of the Hort doesn't put him in charge of everything. Judicator Ulbricht in in charge of strategy here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009556|It's always the same with you newcomers.|Frustrated
INFO_IKENI7_00009555|Johann.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009554|Ulbricht.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009553|Reinhold.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009552|What is the name of the Judicator who deals with the war against the Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009551|Now, to the second question.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009550|You must beg Calaan's forgiveness!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009549|Mor...gon? Who told you that nonsense?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009548|Morgon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009547|No idea??? Calaan! Cal-aan...oh for goodness sake, are you a complete moron?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009546|No idea.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009545|Calaan, may he grace us with his wisdom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009544|Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009543|What is the name of the god we worship?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009542|Let's begin.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009541|Let us see what you have learned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009540|The foundations of faith.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009539|Then you won't mind if I test your knowledge, Acolyte.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009537|Weapons alone won't help you. It's all about discipline and dedication.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009536|No. I'm only interested in your weapons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009535|Yes, I am learning the teachings of Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009534|Duty nurtures the soul.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009533|Ah, and, Martha really does put a good meal together.|Pleased to see his food
INFO_IKENI7_00009532|I am here on behalf of Martha.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009530|Ah, and welcome to the Clerics! It's good too see a new recruit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009529|Stew again then? Well, Martha does the best with what she has.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009528|I think you'll have to lower your expectations.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009527|What I would give for a real steak. That's about the only reason I can think of for leaving the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009526|Protein supplement stew again?|Disappointed
INFO_IKENI7_00009525|Aw, it's about time, thanks. I am ravenous. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009524|I've brought you some food.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009523|But, that is your choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009522|It is also not fair to have to stand guard day in and day out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009521|I knew you would make an excellent Acolyte.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009520|That wouldn't be fair.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009519|Here, take what you want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009518|And, there's no reason at all to tell Martha of this arrangement.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009517|I pay, of course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009516|They understand how hard guard duty is and they leave me a double portion of rations.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009515|Now, as an Acolyte I'm sure you'll honor the deal I have with the others.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009514|I'm glad to have you amongst our ranks. You are honored, we are honored, honor abounds.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009513|So, you have become an Acolyte.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009512|Here, your daily rations.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009511|And, the complaints weren't about being late.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009510|It seems you're all set to climb the ranks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009509|But, you'll need to talk to Reinhold about this. He'll decide what to do with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009508|So, I can put in a word for you, seeing as you completed the task in a way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009507|People've been saying you didn't give everyone their fair share. That's not how things need to work here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009506|Really? None? Because, I've had a few complaints.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009505|Good, then we can call your service to the community complete.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009504|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009503|Were there any problems during your rounds?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009501|We help each other, trust each other and work together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009500|And, remember, this is how our community works.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009499|Just cover those four people, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009498|You helped me, I'll help you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009496|Well, you got that done in good time, I hope you managed to be humble too. |With a smile
INFO_IKENI7_00009494|You do know that punctuality is a virtue?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009493|You took your time completing that task.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009492|The stew has been distributed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009491|Thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009490|So, you don't want me to take rations to everyone?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009489|So, off you go. And, be humble!|With a smile
INFO_IKENI7_00009488|I'll take care of the others.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009487|Of course. Here, take this stew to Balder, Xander, Anna and Reinhold.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009486|Rest up and come back during the day.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009485|I don't know when you eat your meals, but normal people don't eat so late.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009484|At this hour?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009483|I still need time. You'll have to come back later.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009482|I am here to distribute the rations.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009480|Great. You'll have to come back later once they're prepared.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009479|It seems of all lessons, humility is one you do need to learn.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009478|Then that someone else can become Legate in your place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009477|I'll distribute the rations.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009476|Someone else can do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009475|So, you can help me distribute the rations according to our tradition.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009474|Oh, you don't need me, you need to do something that proves you are humble before Calaan. Humility counts for a lot here.|Modest
INFO_IKENI7_00009473|I need your approval for promotion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009472|We need to encourage new Initiates.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009471|And, with everything else going on here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009470|You Acolytes have it hard enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009469|Why me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009468|I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009467|I can't accept that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009466|A merchant gave it to me. I don't drink, but you look like you can use it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009465|Here, something to welcome you as a new Acolyte.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009464|A new Initiate. It's great to see that you've joined us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009462|What do you want doing?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009461|That said...maybe I can think of a way for you to earn some shards. If you're willing?|Reconsidering
INFO_IKENI7_00009460|That should be enough to make it clear I don't have anything against you. But, you know this work is tricky. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009458|On the balance of averages, that's the sort of person who turns up without warning like you. No offense.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009457|That is what I must do now. There is a poor wretch who requires reeducation. Leave me, I must help him find the light of Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009456|Asshole!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009455|You brought this one yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009454|You could've walked away.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009453|Last chance. Pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009452|There's you. Fucking off with no shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009451|Oh, look.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009450|Here's me standing here. Not paying.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009449|Oh look.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009448|Exactly, there's no need for a fight. So, fuck off. Now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009447|You're paying, asshole.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009445|You don't have to turn this into a fight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009443|So, get the fuck out of my face.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009442|If I was going to pay, I would've paid already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009441|You're going to pay every shard you owe.|Cold, professional
INFO_IKENI7_00009440|I don't want trouble, I just want to collect the shards you owe.|Calming
INFO_IKENI7_00009439|You won't get me to pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009438|Well, you picked the wrong debt.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009437|Now, there's the face of a debt collector.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009436|Fuck off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009435|Pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009434|It's about sending a message so other assholes don't try and rip me off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009433|This isn't just about the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009432|It's a good job you got those shards before that asshole got himself killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009431|Because, that is all I can pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009430|You can shake me upside down, or kill me, but that's all you are going to get.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009429|Here, I know this doesn't cover the debt.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009428|Okay, okay, I can pay, but I can only pay some. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009427|A bodyguard that runs away at the first sight of trouble?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009426|Yeah. I could be your bodyguard, or something?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009425|She's got a long memory, huh?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009424|Your debt. You pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009423|Maybe, she's really grateful to you for getting it. Maybe she 'thanks' you, hey? |Insinuating that if the player pays, he might get lucky with Chloe.
INFO_IKENI7_00009422|Yeah. You seem to like this Chloe. You pay, she gets her money and hey, who knows...|Insinuating that if the player pays, he might get lucky with Chloe.
INFO_IKENI7_00009421|You want me to pay for you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009420|Work off the debt?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009419|Chloe's not going to forget what you owe her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009417|Can't you forget about it? Or let me work off the debt, or pay it for me, or something?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009416|I'm new here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009415|Hey, give me a chance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009414|Running off proves you owe Chloe. So, pay up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009413|Was that a threat?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009412|You don't?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009411|Hey, don't push me into a corner. You know what they say about cornered animals.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009410|I don't believe you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009409|Run again and I'll break your legs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009408|Okay, okay, wait. I don't have your shards, that's why I didn't pay, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009407|You got your shards, leave me alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009406|I love this place. Oh, not a care in the damn world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009405|Hey, what, wait, what's that behind you?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009404|Lying, why would I lie? I'm a Berserker, not an Outlaw. I believe in law, in justice in -|
INFO_IKENI7_00009403|Let me just....|

INFO_IKENI7_00009392|Owe? I don't owe anyone a shard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009391|Come on, why are you looking at me like that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009390|You're one of the Berserkers who ran up a debt in Chloe's place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009389|I'm here to collect the shards you owe Chloe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009388|What do you want?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009387|What's wrong?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009386|Then give me your word, or lose your customers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009385|No chance. You think I want people like people coming in here throwing their weight around and scaring off my customers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009384|I'm not leaving until I've got your word.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009383|So, I'll pay, okay? |
INFO_IKENI7_00009382|Not to die here.|

INFO_IKENI7_00009369|Listen, hey, all right. I didn't come here for trouble.|

INFO_IKENI7_00009365|Pay up. Now.|Firm
INFO_IKENI7_00009364|Hey, what? You'll kill me over that much Elexit?|Worried
INFO_IKENI7_00009363|Because if you don't pay, I'll kill you and take the shards.|Firm, calm.
INFO_IKENI7_00009362|You're threatening to kick me out of here?|Worried
INFO_IKENI7_00009361|You want to keep your freedom, pay the debt.|Firm, calm.
INFO_IKENI7_00009360|I didn't leave the Berserkers just to have someone else tell me what to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009359|No laws, means 'no' laws. So, why should I pay her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009356|That's why we all came here!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009355|That's why I came here.|Agreeing
INFO_IKENI7_00009354|What are you talking about?|confused
INFO_IKENI7_00009353|Freedom, no consequences.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009352|It's what everyone knows, why else would you come and live in this desert?|Superior
INFO_IKENI7_00009351|And, now if you want to stay here, you'll pay your debt to Chloe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009350|Is that what you think?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009349|Isn't this the place? No Laws, no duties, just whatever you want, whenever you want it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009346|You can tell William that you have my word. You've earned the right to become a Captain.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009345|So, you got all three of them to pay back. You really are good. So good you have something from me that is invaluable, trust.|Assessing the player
INFO_IKENI7_00009344|By the Arena?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009343|I found one Berserker over by the Arena, he paid up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009342|He ran up a debt with me and then went shopping? What a shithead!|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00009341|I got these shards from a Berserker who was hanging around the market place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009340|I got these shards back from a Berserker I found in the entertainment district.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009339|Good work. I hope he's still feeling sorry for not paying straight away. Assholes like that need to learn.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009336|So, to get your support to become a Captain...|
INFO_IKENI7_00009335|So, get my shards back from those tree loving throwbacks won't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009334|They should be recognizable, they are the only three Berserkers I know of in the Fort right now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009333|One of my asshole barman let them run up a big tab before I found out. He's already paid the price for that, now they need to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009332|That's part of the problem. I don't know. They're not Outlaws, they're Berserkers who arrived here recently.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009331|Tell me who owes you money.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009330|If you think you have what it takes to be an Captain, you'll get that money.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009329|There are three guys who owe me shards who have...resisted my attempts to persuade them to pay up.|Choosing her words
INFO_IKENI7_00009328|But...I am getting an idea how I can help you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009327|No, I'm not interested in being paid with my own money.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009326|If you're that determined...There's only one way you can get my word.|Reluctant, thinking it over
INFO_IKENI7_00009325|And, before you get too wound up, remember I was part of getting the promotion you've already had.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009324|All right, all right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009322|And how about you then turn up and steal those shards back, so I end up with nothing?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009321|I'm not a Runner, I'm not fetching you more bottles.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009320|How about I pay for your word?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009319|But...but, if you were able to bring me some more bottles of liquor, maybe I would change my mind.|Relenting
INFO_IKENI7_00009318|Well, you're too late, I've already promised my word to your two rivals. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009317|Oh no, don't tell me you now want to become a Captain?|Guessing the player's intention
INFO_IKENI7_00009316|That's our business done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009315|Here, take your shards back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009314|Since you have already taken my shards, I don't have to give you anything back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009312|I haven't had such a close fight for a long time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009311|I have to say, I underestimated you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009310|Time for me to take my promotion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009309|Time for you to move on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009308|You're not the first person I've beaten. That list is pretty damn long.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009307|Don't be hard on yourself.|Sneering
INFO_IKENI7_00009306|This is your only chance. You lose, you've lost for good, you won't get a second chance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009305|You've talked the talk. Ready to find out what you've talked yourself into?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009304|Then, I'll meet that challenge. Come to the Arena. I'll meet you in the Cage.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009302|Are you fighting me, or someone else? There's already someone in the Arena.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00009301|I challenge you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009300|We will deal with this fight as soon as you are ready.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009299|But...You paid and I stand by my word.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009298|I could earn that much scavenging a picked out ruin.|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00009297|What? You expect me to give up promotion for that?|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00009296|Take these shards and meet me in the Arena.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009295|Fighting you won't mean anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009294|I've proved myself already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009293|Keep your tough man act.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009292|You wait, you work, you prove yourself. You make yourself an Outlaw, hell, you'll have my backing, but until then forget that promotion.|Firm
INFO_IKENI7_00009291|No, you just have to stay out of my way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009290|Whatever you did in the past, you're not as good as me today.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009289|I don't have to prove myself to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009288|What do you know about Tavar? Where were you when the Duke and Nasty took this place from Baxter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009286|He knows he can depend on me. He knows I'll bring him profits.|Prickly pride
INFO_IKENI7_00009285|I've been working for the Duke for years.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009284|You can wait your turn.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009283|Well, we'll see about that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009278|Well, you're too late. That promotion is mine.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009277|So, it's you?|Confrontational
INFO_IKENI7_00009276|I heard you want to become a Captain?|Hostile
INFO_IKENI7_00009275|We have nothing to say to each other.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009274|That's what I thought, you'd better watch out, someone will want to take you down.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009273|I guess I get the promotion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009272|Aw, fuck, I can't believe I've blown it because of an asshole like you!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009271|You asshole! This was my year for promotion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009270|I'm going for a smoke.|Leaving
INFO_IKENI7_00009269|And, you can forget about a rematch.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009268|I told you you weren't up to becoming a Captain.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009267|Time to take you out of the running.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009266|Four assholes in my way, now become five.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009265|So, get the other guy out of the Arena if you want to fight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009264|I'm not into threesomes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009263|Get your ass to the Arena, Let's finish this now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009262|Let's fight now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009261|If we have to do this, let's get the fight out of the way, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009260|I've earned it and you're...still looking like you're going to get in my way.|Trailing off the talk as he realises the player chararacter isn't convinced.
INFO_IKENI7_00009259|I'm getting the promotion this time round.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009258|Don't make it five.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009257|Four people have tried to bump me out of my place this month.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009255|We could both get promoted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009254|You really don't want to get yourself in a place where you're pissing in my pond. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009253|Any reason I shouldn't just kill you here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009252|Scared I'll beat you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009250|And, I want to finish my smoke. So, how about you wait a little longer and don't get in my way?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009249|How about you just kiss my ass?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009248|You're not quite as dumb as you look.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009247|I want promotion this time round.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009246|You put that together all by yourself with no advice. So, put this together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009245|Hey, look at you. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009244|So, you want to be a Captain?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009243|Why should I worry about someone who hasn't got the balls to take what they want? And, look at me, I'm not worried.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009242|Smarts, you see? I got them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009241|Why pay if you can take?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009240|I should take advice from someone who can't afford their own smokes?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009239|But...you just don't look like you're going to make the cut. So, take the advice, give me a smoke and give up on that promotion.|Assessing the player character
INFO_IKENI7_00009238|I guess they want to make sure you can handle yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009237|Don't try that, I've been told you have to win in the Arena to become a Captain.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009236|Who says I want to fight?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009235|Give me a minute to grab a smoke before I beat you bloody.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009234|I hear you think you're going to get named as a Captain?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009233|Hey, asshole. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009232|But, her word still carries weight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009231|She's so desperate for favors she'll let anyone have her word.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009230|Chloe will speak for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009229|Oh, and seeing as you've delivered on the task...Take this as thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009228|Tell William you've got my word.|Giving in
INFO_IKENI7_00009227|All right, I'll help you, just don't forget the little people once you've climbed that greasy pole.|Wary of people who think they're better than others.
INFO_IKENI7_00009226|So, you really want to be a Enforcer?|Assessing the player
INFO_IKENI7_00009225|All right. As long as you don't work against me, I 'll help you.|Giving in
INFO_IKENI7_00009224|Those bottles bought you a smile, but don't think they mean I'll let you screw me over. You need to rethink your attitude. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009223|You're a boss, you should understand why I want promotion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009222|Help me get promoted, or I'll take over your business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009221|You're a good Runner, why do you want promotion?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009220|That will whet a few throats.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009219|Now, that is a sight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009218|I found the bottles you want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009217|The place has been picked clean over the years, but from what the scavengers say there has to be something left in there somewhere. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009216|It's up in the northwest in an old factory where they used to distill the stuff.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009215|Well, all right, if you need a lead, the scrap scavengers have been talking about a place.|Thinking it through
INFO_IKENI7_00009214|Are you really telling me you've not found Old World alcohol when you've been scavenging in the desert?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009213|I don't know. I get most of my supplies from scavengers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009212|Where am I supposed to get these bottles?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009211|Get me...say at least ten bottles, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009209|So, I need you to track down some high proof supplies for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009208|We're always running low on alcohol here. And if we don't keep this mob well greased, then morale will plummet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009207|Don't worry, it's not that bad, I just want you to help top up my stocks.|Letting the player off the hook
INFO_IKENI7_00009206|A good choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009205|Just, tell me what I have to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009204|Yes. You'll have to run to Xacor if I ask you to. You want my word, you'll do what I ask.|Pleased, toying with the player.
INFO_IKENI7_00009203|You expect me just to do what you want?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009202|So, you're going to do what every Runner who comes here looking for my word has to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009201|All right, but you're ambition will cost you. I have a reputation and that comes with a price.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009200|You've just become a Runner and you already want to become an Enforcer?|Assessing the player
INFO_IKENI7_00009199|I need your word so I can become an Enforcer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009198|You think people will trust someone who doesn't ask for shards? That just makes people wonder what you really want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009197|Don't be an ass. Ask for a damn payment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009196|Timer set, time to go.|to self - calm
INFO_IKENI7_00009194|But, good, let's cross him off the list.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009193|That can't have been easy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009192|The Scrap Baron is satisfied.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009190|Time to get out of here.|to self - calm
INFO_IKENI7_00009189|That's set.|to self - calm
INFO_IKENI7_00009188|I wasn't expecting to see you here, I was...I thought someone else would be here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009187|Dealt with one problem - the danger of prying eyes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009186|Yeah, didn't think that through.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009185|You thought the desert would be safe?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009184|They call me, Weasel. Scrap scavenger and traveling trader.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009183|Who are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009182|Maybe, we will see each other again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009181|Well, time to move on, there's nothing else for me here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009180|As long as I can find the shards to get by then little else matters.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009179|I don't know. I guess I'll just follow my nose.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009178|Where are you off to next?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009177|Even Clerics seem to deal more straightforwardly out here and you'd think they'd freak out in all this...nature.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009176|Fewer distractions for everyone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009175|People tend to deal straighter when they're out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009174|Oh, no. Towns are people and other complications.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009173|You're more of a town guy?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009172|Next time, I'm going to pick somewhere safer to make a trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009171|I wouldn't have thought this area would be so dangerous.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009170|And, I shall serve Calaan's will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009169|But, perhaps that is Calaan's plan, to send you here to die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009168|Magalan belongs to Calaan. You should open your mind to his words.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009167|You are desecrating this place with your presence.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009166|Let me in, or I'll send you to go and see Calaan personally.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009165|Just let me by.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009164|You really believe the shit they preach to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009163|Sacred, my ass. Tavar belongs to the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009162|Not to be defiled by your kind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009161|This is a sacred place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009160|What's an Outlaw doing at our shrine?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009159|Time to get back to the Scrap Baron.|to self - calm
INFO_IKENI7_00009158|That's going to upset the Clerics...|to self - calm
INFO_IKENI7_00009157|That's one for the Scrap Baron.|to self - calm
INFO_IKENI7_00009156|I'm done here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009155|Here is yours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009154|I can and I will. Every man should take his share.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009153|And, you can pay me for destroying the shrines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009152|That's all I wanted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009150|You can have my word for that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009149|That was good work. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009148|There should be some valuable salvage there, you can take that as a bonus for yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009147|Good, then we should be rid of those Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009146|The explosives are in place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009144|Look for them near the old road.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009143|Just the ones here in Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009142|Which shrines do you want destroyed?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009141|Let's rid Tavar of them and their machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009140|Come back when you've rigged those shrines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009138|I want them to blow as soon as those Clerics kneel to their god.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009137|Here, take these explosives and rig their shrines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009135|They can't travel anywhere without building somewhere to kneel to this god of theirs. So, let's send them to him. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009134|How can we take their god from them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009133|Tell me about the Clerics' shrines...|
INFO_IKENI7_00009132|So, we'll take their god from them. Let's destroy their shiny shrines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009131|They come here, taking our salvage, eating our profits.|Anger building
INFO_IKENI7_00009130|We're going to take the fight to those Clerics. |With relish
INFO_IKENI7_00009129|You're going to help me show the Duke the way forward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009128|If you want my word, you'll do what you're told, not just what you want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009127|I mean do what you're told without all these questions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009126|What do you mean stop at nothing?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009125|Comedians and psychos, the Fort is full of them. You should only kill for profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009124|What do you want me to do? Kill the next person that comes along.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009122|Why should I help someone who won't commit? You have to go for it. Seize the moment. Prove that you'll stop at nothing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009121|This will take as long as I decide it needs to take. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009120|You need something from me, so cut the backchat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009119|Let's make this quick, yeah?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009117|Tell me what I have to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009115|Well, it seems he needs me, you need me, it's nice to be wanted.|Warm
INFO_IKENI7_00009114|William sent you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009113|I need your word to be promoted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009112|They aren't always as welcoming as they should be.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009111|I am happy to welcome you to our ranks.|Friendly, positive
INFO_IKENI7_00009110|Then travel safely and don't let the Albs catch you with that message.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009109|If that is everything you should be on your way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009108|I am done here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009107|Now, you take payment for your services. That should make your return trip much easier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009106|I've delivered the message. What now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009105|What we are supposed to make of this proposal remains to be seen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009104|It seems Warlord Cormag has finally acknowledged this and is committing to withdrawing his forces from our border so we may both focus on the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009103|A statement of intent, a commitment. I think people must see that the Albs are a threat to all the Free People. Be you Berserker, or Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009102|What is in the message?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009101|I can't do anything else for you at the moment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009099|That is a big step forward in your duties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009098|Congratulations on winning that pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009097|I had heard you were in favor with the Hammer clan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009096|I have Cormag's pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009095|Here, this is well worth the success of your mission.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009094|And, because you left the seal untouched, I will reward you with Elexit as well as my thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009093|He would have sent you right back to the fields.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009092|But, breaking my seal was stupid of you. You can count yourself lucky that I am not Angrim.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009091|You have my thanks and my support.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009090|You have certainly earned my pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009089|Next, comes the small job of convincing Angrim and Ragnar that this diplomatic course is the best way forward.|Knowing it will be difficult
INFO_IKENI7_00009088|We might not be at the negotiating table just yet, but it's a start.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009087|As far as I can see they were pleased with you. That bodes well for the future.|If the player didn't read the letter
INFO_IKENI7_00009086|But, it didn't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009085|Opening it could have endangered our whole enterprise.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009083|Wait...you were instructed to deliver the message with an unbroken seal.|Concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00009082|Now, I know it is possible to open diplomatic relations with the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009081|Yes. Here is their letter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009080|I assume you were given something to bring back?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009079|The fact you were allowed to return is a good sign.|Hopeful, but reserved
INFO_IKENI7_00009078|I delivered your message to Reinhold the Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009077|You should consider that payment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009076|By the way, I took the opportunity to write down a few lines of praise as thanks for your efforts in delivering these messages.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009075|I didn't use a seal. It seemed pointless with you as my messenger.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009074|Take this message back with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009073|Good, it is now clear to me what is expected of us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009072|Give me a moment. I must study this document.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009071|It seems you Berserkers are more trustworthy than the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009070|And, the seal is unbroken.|Examining the note
INFO_IKENI7_00009069|But, what should I expect from a Berserker?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009068|Didn't anyone tell you not to break the seal?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009067|Why is the seal broken?|Examining the note
INFO_IKENI7_00009066|Here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009065|Then you had better give it to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009064|I have a message for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009063|Warlord Cormag? What does that Berserker want now?|Intrigued
INFO_IKENI7_00009062|Warlord Cormag sent me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009061|But, if I trust you with this message, you must not break the seal. The message must reach Reinhold unbroken.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009060|To achieve that, I need to get a message to Judicator Reinhold in Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009059|If we can persuade them not just to keep peace between us, but to coordinate our attacks against the Albs, I believe we can change the course of this war.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009058|The Clerics are in exactly the same situation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009057|We're fighting on too many fronts and the Albs are only getting stronger.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009056|Peace.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009055|What do you need in Ignadon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009054|And, I need you to do it discreetly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009053|I need you to travel to Ignadon for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009052|There aren't many here who really understand what is happening beyond our borders. That's where you come in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009050|Well, if you are set on it, there is a task you can do to earn my pledge.|option C
INFO_IKENI7_00009049|I am ready to become a Paladin. I won't disappoint you.|option B
INFO_IKENI7_00009048|You have proven yourself loyal to the Berserkers, but there is more to such a promotion. More than words.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009047|I am the best choice you could find.|option A
INFO_IKENI7_00009046|It normally takes years to reach that rank.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009045|But, don't you think you might be overreaching yourself a little?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009044|I admire your ambition.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009043|Do I have your support to become a Paladin?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009042|Quickly, you need to defend the northern entrance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009041|Kill him, bring him back a prisoner. Just stop the attacks on us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009040|Cross the river and look around there. I'd bet they haven't covered their tracks too well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009039|Somewhere to the east of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009038|Where are the reavers hiding out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009037|If you can impress Angrim, you have taken a big step forward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009036|Then you must have followed Berserker Law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009035|I have Angrim's pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009034|If you need it, you can tell Warlord Ragnar that you have my support.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009033|Here, take this. I hope it makes up for your part in this mess.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009031|Good. Good. Finally some good news.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009030|The reaver leader won't cause you any more trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009029|If I secure the camp can you find that bastard?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009028|I can't see the leader of the reavers amongst the dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009027|We've barely enough supplies to get by, so I don't know what they expect to get from us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009025|Of all the places they could raid they have to hit us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009024|These damn reavers. |
INFO_IKENI7_00009022|Hopefully, you will get there in time, before everything we have built has been destroyed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009021|This was the task I was going to give to Gunnar, but it seems another will have to take his place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009020|It's pretty dangerous out there. You'll need to keep an eye open, there are plenty of ambush sites.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009019|I'll take the southern! Now, go!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009018|They're coming for us!|
INFO_IKENI7_00009017|Good. And not a moment too soon!|They are attacking at that moment, so this is surprised.
INFO_IKENI7_00009016|Are you scared of reavers? Or, is it that you just don't care about us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009015|Yes, I'll help you fight the reavers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009014|Count me out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009013|But, maybe, we have a surprise for them, in you. If you'll help us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009012|They've been scouting us for another attack. They know how low on troops we are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009011|Of course. There are reavers out here, so they hit us. Last time they came at us during the night, if I hadn't upped the guard roster, we'd be dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009010|Do you have a problem with reaver attacks?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009009|You must gain the pledge of each Warlord before you may be named as a Paladin.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009008|You know the challenge that faces you before you may take that title.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009007|Wear this title with pride and, in the name of the Pilgrim, hold fast the defense of Edan and help us carry forward the cause of the Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009006|Today you join the ranks of the Paladins.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009005|I will not see your exemplary actions go unrewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009004|And, you have done a great service to our community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009003|You have the pledges of the Warlords.|
INFO_IKENI7_00009002|Are you ready to name me as a Paladin?|
INFO_IKENI7_00009000|A rabid dog won't listen to reason, it needs to be put out of its misery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008999|That is exactly what I wanted to hear.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008998|Their leader is dead. They shouldn't trouble you any longer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008997|Did Thorgal deal with them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008996|Where are the reavers now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008995|Reavers attacked Thorgal's post.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008994|He will know what needs to be done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008993|These raids have to end. I know it is a long journey, but these reavers must be stopped and I think you're the man to do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008992|Look for Thorgal near the World Heart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008991|I need someone to find these reavers and put an end to the raiding.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008990|The number of reaver raids between Edan and Abessa is increasing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008989|What task do you require me to complete?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008988|Very well. It is a task best considered thoroughly, I am pleased you have decided to try.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008987|Yes, I am ready to take on the challenge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008986|You told me yourself that you were unready. Has that changed?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008985|I want to talk about my promotion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008984|Few are. I am not surprised that you find yourself wanting.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008983|Good. Then go to the Warlords to learn your duties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008982|No, I'm not ready.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008981|I am ready.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008980|Do you think you are ready for such responsibilities? Are you ready to take on the challenges you must face to reach this rank?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008979|You will teach others by example when it comes to the Law and to your fighting skills. You will be the first we ask for when a World Heart is endangered.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008978|Paladins are the vanguard, the rock of our forces.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008977|If you are to become a Paladin then you will lead the fight against our enemies. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008976|We will see if you are ready.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008975|I am ready to take that challenge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008974|That is not a question to toy with, becoming a Paladin is a high honor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008973|What do I have to do to become a Paladin?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008971|It seems you are earning a place here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008970|Winning Angrim over cannot have been easy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008969|Angrim has given me his pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008968|Yes. Sure, whatever. Just don't ever offer to do me a fucking favor ever again, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008967|Are we all square?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008966|Then give it to me before I explode again!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008965|You do?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008964|I have something from Caldrim.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008963|Holy shit, you'd better get us some medicine from somewhere, or there'll not be one of us left in a day or two.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008962|You've given us the shits, you shit! That damned bread of yours!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008961|You offered food to hungry men, of course we took it! Oh, by the Pilgrim, you have to do something!|Trying not to soil himself
INFO_IKENI7_00008960|How are your guts my fault?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008959|That was what I could get. You said you wanted it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008958|There's not one of us that's not been throwing up, or shitting our damn pants. What the hell was wrong with that bread?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008957|Oh, by the Clerics' god I think my bowels are going to blow. That, that, bread you gave us. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008956|You...you...shit.|Angry, and still ill
INFO_IKENI7_00008955|Thank you, thank you, all funds are extremely helpful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008954|Please, take this Elexit as thanks.|Minus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00008953|But, we are terribly short of funds here, some payment should be due.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008952|No? No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008951|I don't want to make a donation.|plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00008950|I trust that you are willing to pay for them? That you will make a donation to our cause as thanks?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008949|But, I have to say that it did require some quite rare ingredients.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008948|I have the preparation ready.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008947|Ah, yes, I'd heard he had fallen ill.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008946|I was sent to collect healing herbs for Irdor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008944|Oh, you joined us. Welcome, but don't think you'll get a discount.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008943|Good, then you have taken a step towards promotion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008942|Cormag has pledged me his support.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008941|As thanks for your services to the Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008940|You can tell Ragnar that you have my pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008939|You can tell Ragnar that Cormag has given you his pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008938|Yes, you shall have my support.|Option, if the player has not done anything wrong
INFO_IKENI7_00008937|Good. Then he must be twice thankful for your help, in intention at least.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008936|Irdor has received the medicine he needed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008935|If you want to make good on your intention then collect them and take them to Irdor. That's the only way you will have my pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008934|Caldrim has prepared some healing herbs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008933|Normally, such an act of kindness would be praised, but instead, he is suffering from extreme diarrhea.|Revealing his annoyance
INFO_IKENI7_00008932|I've heard of your kindness to Irdor, that you arranged to get supplies for him?|Straight setting things up
INFO_IKENI7_00008931|Follow him. Discover if all the shards he collects are being paid over to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008930|I hope there's a just reason for this, but I fear he may be lining his own pockets.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008929|The taxes Zerwas has collected recently have been lower than would be expected.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008928|I'm worried that Goliet's Master of Duties may have forgotten his duty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008927|My task is simple enough.|Both options lead to this
INFO_IKENI7_00008926|You must earn your right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008925|Because of questions like that. Duty is earned not deserved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008924|Why not just promote me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008923|Tell me what I must do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008922|Learn those lessons and you will get my pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008921|And that it must be our duty to protect it. |Both 67 and 68 lead to this line
INFO_IKENI7_00008920|Ambition is nothing without action. Prove yourself and promotion will follow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008919|But, all Berserkers must begin their duty in the fields. It is in the fields that we learn how precious and fragile life is.|Continous from above
INFO_IKENI7_00008918|Your skills might be used better elsewhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008917|How can I prove myself as a farmer?|Unimpressed with the role.
INFO_IKENI7_00008916|I don't intend to be a Cultivator for long.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008915|I know you must have much to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008914|Don't let me keep you from your duties as a Cultivator.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008913|You will be a valuable addition to our ranks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008912|I am glad you decided to join us.|All joining options lead into this one
INFO_IKENI7_00008910|I will have to inform Ragnar.|Concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00008909|This must be Gunnar.|Talking to himself, Observing Gunnar's body
INFO_IKENI7_00008907|A waste of a good man.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008906|And, if you inspire others to speak for you, this may help persuade the Warlords to give you their pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008905|Until you have all their pledges, you cannot be promoted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008904|You might be ready, but you have not yet earned the support of all Warlords.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008903|Go see our smith. He will sell you some suitable armor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008902|You tie your blood to the soils of Magalan our mother planet. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008901|With honor, with faith, with hope.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008900|Then so shall it be.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008899|I am ready to be promoted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008897|Thank you for bringing me this news. You have earned my pledge. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008895|Of all the people, I would not have expected him to find his death there.|Saddened
INFO_IKENI7_00008894|I found his corpse in the Valley.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008893|Why? What is wrong with him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008892|Gunnar can't help you anymore.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008891|We just haven't had the people spare to keep a proper eye on the exiled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008890|I admit we have been lax in checking of late.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008889|He is supposed to report to the ruins below the lift in the Valley.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008888|Where in the Valley of the Damned is he?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008887|And Gunnar is a man determined about a task once it is started.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008884|So, go. Bring him back for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008883|I am certain he can prove that he has served his sentence and is ready to return.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008882|He earned the rank of Paladin and I hope he can prove his loyalty if he returns to Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008881|I have given you my instructions, carry them out and find Gunnar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008880|What is he doing in the Valley of the Damned?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008879|I could do the task for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008878|Tell him I need him for a special task. He is to return to Goliet immediately.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008877|He is in the Valley of the Damned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008876|You can start be finding Gunnar for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008875|I will if you can prove your loyalty and usefulness.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008874|Will you give me your pledge?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008873|About my promotion to Warrior...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008871|Prove yourself capable of following orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008870|Until then, you will carry out your duties as a Cultivator. Ultimately, we can't leave the fields to themselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008869|The only way to get an early promotion would be to get all Warlords to agree to that. Each of us have our own beliefs and requirements and sometimes they will come into conflict.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008868|Show more respect, or do you want your stay here to be short?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008867|I don't have that much time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008866|There must be a way to climb faster here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008865|Don't compare me to the rest of the failures.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008864|It could take years until you are ready for that step.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008863|Listen, friend. Most people who have achieved the rank of Warrior worked hard for it. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008862|What do I have to do to be promoted?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008861|No one who has seen a mutant with their own eyes can deny that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008860|Of course, as a loyal and honest Berserker you won't catch me saying things like that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008858|Well, you know what they say, one man's forbidden is another man's profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008857|Sort of the important part of 'Valley of the Damned'.|Pointing out the obvious
INFO_IKENI7_00008853|And, they did well. In the end they were the first to see the deviant nature of technology.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008852|They taught us that we cannot give into the temptation that awaits us outside of our walls.|Fervent
INFO_IKENI7_00008851|Our founding fathers knew well that you have to be really careful who you trust.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008850|So, you don't trust anyone?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008849|There's no others will be so fair to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008847|You work hard here, you're rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008846|We're working together to make this world better.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008845|Or, an Elex addiction like those Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008844|I know, I know, we have our Laws, but better that than a knife at your throat like the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008843|We're the only real free people there are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008842|Who are the Berserkers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008841|If you say so.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008840|With respect for all his great feats, he was a bit of a miserable bastard to be honest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008839|And, Eisenfaust wasn't exactly known for his poetic side.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008836|As Eisenfaust said...of all the places and all the people on Magalan, the planet chose us to give magic to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008835|I hope you can see that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008834|We need to build one world, together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008833|What's the point in us seeking to rebuild the world if we continue fighting?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008832|So, where ever you came from your help is welcome.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008831|We Berserkers believe in second chances. It's your choice whether you take that chance, or not.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008829|And, they will likely reward you for your trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008828|Once they do they will open their doors to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008826|I wish could offer aid to all those in need.|Helpful
INFO_IKENI7_00008825|Oh, yeah, why would I be upset?|Sarcastic
INFO_IKENI7_00008824|Stick to the Laws, respect our ways and you will find Goliet welcoming.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008823|The fifth Law states all Free People are equal. All must be given protection when it is asked for, all may repent their ways and join the Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008822|Millions died when the Comet hit. Our whole species was headed for extinction. And, you've seen it out there, people are doing their best to finish that job.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008821|But, our laws are more than that. Berserker Laws tell us who we are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008819|Steal, lie, cheat, kill and justice will be swift. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008818|You will have a fair chance here if you understand that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008817|Break the Laws, show contempt and punishment will follow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008815|It is my duty, along with the other Warlords, to ensure the Laws are kept and the Berserker way preserved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008813|My name is Angrim.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008811|There's enough creatures out here trying to eat me, without people trying it as well! Shit. Shit. |Still wound up
INFO_IKENI7_00008810|Cook?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008808|The selection is more limited than I'd like, but it's what we have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008806|You see, these field do grow more than plants.|Proud
INFO_IKENI7_00008805|And, that's left me short of people to gather the healing roots our healers are demanding.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008804|Traders need to be authorized and what they can sell is restricted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008803|But, there are others who would exile you from the town just for saying that technology can make a difference.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008800|You should know that Goliet is eternally vigilant in its search for Albs.|Self-important
INFO_IKENI7_00008799|I'm already on the Archive access list.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008798|Name added to the access list, that should get me in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008797|Computer controlling access to something. I should leave this for now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008796|Maybe. I'll think about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008793|But, and I'm getting to the point, here's me, right? A loyal and honest Berserker. Someone who knows what's right. What's legal and what's not.|4
INFO_IKENI7_00008792|But, whatever you do next, take it easy, okay, partner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008790|And, you'll get the profit to make your effort worth it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008789|You look like you came through okay. I knew I'd picked the right person.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008787|It would be great to work with you again, but I don't know if I could find the shards to afford it!|Making a joke, jolly
INFO_IKENI7_00008786|Yes, that's right, which means - you are rich! I mean, you can afford to get your balls dipped in gold if you really want to. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008785|40% as agreed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008784|Here, you earned it, partner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008783|You get half right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008782|So, about your share...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008781|You know I was worried you'd deliver me to that shithead Keith, but you kept your word.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008780|The plan worked? It worked!|Surprised then happy
INFO_IKENI7_00008779|I recovered the shards from the convoy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008778|I'm not looking for conversation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008777|Take your shards and keep moving.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008776|You made the right decision.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008775|So, time to pay out the Elexit you promised.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008774|No joke. You're giving me the chests.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008773|Is that supposed to be a joke?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008772|I'm taking the chests.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008771|Logan is the absolute lord of the Wastelands. Bow to the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008770|You backstabbing bastard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008769|You're getting nothing from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008768|No deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008767|Cut me in on the deal and you can have Liam.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008766|Hey! We had a deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008764|You can give me that interfering asshole's head and I'll give you a share of the loot we've got here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008763|If that's the case, I'll give you a once-in-a-lifetime offer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008762|Unless, that guy Liam pulled you into this? Is that what happened?|Indicating Liam
INFO_IKENI7_00008761|Stay out of my business and keep your thoughts to yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008760|You don't know shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008759|You really want to fight?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008758|I know you work for the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008757|Keep your mouth shut, give me some fucking respect, and stop giving me your opinions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008756|And, you're not going to live long with a mouth like that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008755|I don't care what you're wearing, you're no Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008754|Put a muzzle on your dog, or I'll shut him up for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008753|That's one of those guys I told you about! Forget the talking, do something!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008752|Well, you can keep your eyes off what we have here and get your sorry ass back into the desert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008750|Technophile' you know that means someone that loves technology.|Suggesting sex with 'loves'
INFO_IKENI7_00008749|Real men fight with what they've got, they don't hide behind tech.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008748|I don't have time for Clerics. |Disdain.
INFO_IKENI7_00008747|I don't have time for civilians.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008746|Get lost.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008745|But, you're in charge. I'm not that good at decisions, so you shoot, talk and bag up the loot, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008744|You can handle it yourself, I'm sure you can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008743|I'll be no use to you dead and that's what I'll be if I leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008742|My ass belongs to Iron Madison. Hell, all of me belongs to her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008740|Frank? The Cleric we're holding prisoner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008739|This is what I do. I reeducate people. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008738|And, just so you know, the crate of Elex has been is security sealed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008737|Shards would mean safety. But, you know what happened next, damn reavers. Life sure is cheap out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008736|The light beacon. I've always been fascinated by them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008734|That's not something I want to go through again. Hell, you've not got anything to drink have you? Something to help a man get his head screwed back on?|Calming
INFO_IKENI7_00008733|Those reavers still need dealing with!|Pressing the player to action
INFO_IKENI7_00008732|Get rid of those cannibals! Come on!|Pressing the player to action
INFO_IKENI7_00008731|Shit... a moment longer and those cannibals would've had me over the fire.|Still wound up
INFO_IKENI7_00008725|Oh, yes, we'll do you justice, a few sprigs of scragweed and some cog root and you'll be just right for us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008720|Nice, nice...Fresh meat and you've got a fair amount on you. Aw, you're going to cook up nicely.|Salivating
INFO_IKENI7_00008719|We got a nice catch here!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008718|Even if it means ensuring there are no witnesses who can contradict the truth those people need. No witnesses, understand?|Hardline
INFO_IKENI7_00008717|Maybe, maybe, she might give you an idea of how to get rid of Madison.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008716|Why did you do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008715|And about your story, you can tell it to me later, yeah? Let's save that special moment.|Moving the conversation on, he's got what he wants and doesn't really want to hear the player's story..
INFO_IKENI7_00008714|I'm going to find him, but not before I deal with your betrayal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008713|What are you trying to pull? Huh?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008712|Something is wrong here.|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00008711|Didn't you tell me that you would bring Wolf here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008710|Where the hell is he?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008709|And, the work you do will earn you salvation and a way to enter the Infinite Skies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008708|May Calaan's light guide you. May Calaan's wisdom show you the path.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008707|So, no loose ends!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008706|That leaves only one person connected to him. One witness involved in that asshole's plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008705|I'm glad some one killed him. That asshole decided to make my life difficult for nothing. Now, he's paid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008704|So, somebody did the job for me...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008703|Your friend, Wolf, is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008698|So, this is where you brainwash people?|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00008697|This matter is closed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008696|And another death won't help us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008695|Although, when I look at you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008694|That at least will mean we can attract new initiates.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008693|Compensation must be paid, so we can make good the loss you have caused us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008689|For, Calaan needs every soul who will serve if we are to hold back these Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008688|His soul was tortured, but it could have been saved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008687|Who gave you the right to decide the fate of our prisoner?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008685|That might not be enough but I can't do anymore for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008684|If a Suggestor starts trying to get out of you that you had a part in this, you need to reassure him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008683|Here, take this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008682|Then the Hort is safer. We owe you a debt of gratitude.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008681|Eli is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008680|Luckily, he didn't tread so softly, now he's flat, dead, extinguished by the rocks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008679|That bastard Eli came after me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008678|And, now I'm free, you're going to get it, you shithead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008677|But, I have a surprise for you and the rest of the smug assholes here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008676|Exactly. Thought you'd got away with it, didn't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008675|Recognize you? Why should...? Oh, fuck...|Dismissive then realising.
INFO_IKENI7_00008674|What? Don't you recognize me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008673|Then I had better get moving. See you around!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008672|I'll see you be the gate. Much appreciated.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008671|Thanks, finding him, would've been a real risk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008670|Wait outside the gate. I'll get your friend to meet you there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008669|No. Stick with your plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008668|Or, have you got a better idea?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008667|I need to find Wolf, then I can get out of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008666|And, what happens now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008665|Peace find you. Calaan is calling me to work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008664|No, I must be wrong.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008663|Do we know each other?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008662|May Calaan guide us all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008661|His spirit is made pure. He will integrate well into our community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008660|This individual has completed the difficult transformation from reaver to a divine servant of Calaan.|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00008659|Calaan deserves loyalty. Rejoice in Calaan and your rewards will be eternal. You will serve Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008658|But, hurry. I don't know how long I can hold out against the Suggestors. Two days and they might take my mind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008657|Help me get out of here. Please, don't let them send me to re-education.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008656|Calaan is redemption and I am his servant.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008653|If you two made any sort of agreement then you should forget it now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008652|And, I am not going to let anyone get in the way of that. He must be saved from himself. You understand?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008651|Faith is our shield.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008650|If he is going to complete his re-education, his spirit must be reforged.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008649|I've had a report that you spoke to Eli? The prisoner?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008648|Is there anything else you wanted?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008647|Great. You know a good deal when you see one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008646|I'll take the armor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008645|This set belonged to a brother who now dwells in Calaan's Halls, Calaan save and protect his soul. But, it's perfectly fit for purpose.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008644|I have a full range, and a full set if it's the right size.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008643|Well, that all depends on your rank. Would you want undergarments? Nightwear? Armor?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008642|What do most people wear here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008640|Clothing, I have. What exactly do you have in mind?|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00008639|I want to buy some clothes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008637|Our enemies are a good place to get resources.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008636|And, then there are the spoils of war recovered from out there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008635|Mostly from the patrols we send out. They find all sorts of Old World artefacts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008634|Where do you get your goods from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008633|And, I can offer you top quality for a decent price.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008632|I'm here to trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008631|Hey, is there something you're looking for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008629|Then someone can kill him outside the Hort and no one would know. They'd all assume he'd escaped.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008628|Besides, I don't want him hanging round here as a Cleric. No, someone needs to get Eli out of that place and through the Hort's gate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008627|And, taking a chance with him is taking a chance with other people's lives. How is that a fair gamble?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008626|Oh, they can be successful. I've seen enough people turn up here like drones after being given the treatment, but it's not one hundred percent.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008625|Why can't you just leave Eli to the Suggestors?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008624|Whatever story he fed you will be bullshit. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008623|And, that should tell you a lot. 'I' don't know him that well and I know he needs to be put down.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008622|Knows me? He's seen me, we've spoken a few words, but he doesn't 'know' me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008621|Eli says he knows you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008620|He thinks he's a Cleric now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008619|Of course he does. He's been brainwashed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008618|Wolf wants to see you dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008617|And, I am telling you, the guy is a ticking time bomb, that can only end badly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008616|And, now the Suggestors are saying they can correct him. That they can put him in armor and send him out with weapons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008615|I want Eli to disappear. He's a prisoner here and he's...well, he's a threat to the community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008614|It's a bit of an ask. But, an outsider's my best bet for getting it done. You see...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008613|Listen, don't get me wrong. You came from outside and I am still talking to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008612|Maybe. But, outsiders don't usually work out well here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008611|Do you need something doing here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008610|Are you trying to say I'm a criminal?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008609|But, maybe you're not a prisoner sent here by a Suggestor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008603|Cross a Suggestor and there's a good chance you'll get sent here to try and mine out rock after someone's rewired your brain.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008602|Not that the people they send here are always better than machines.|Disappointed
INFO_IKENI7_00008598|Not that those benefits'd do much if those rocks came down on top of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008597|I thought you guys were allergic to technology.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008596|Say, what's a Berserker doing out here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008595|Well, producing enough for the front line is the Hort's first priority. Besides, there's more to mining than boring and smashing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008594|They claim it's too tricky for robots. I think it's just too tricky for the programmers. They assumed mining was easy, and so - pah! Several flat robots proved them wrong.|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00008592|And, feed the production lines. They tried to fully automate the process, but it failed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008591|Why don't you just have the machines work for you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008590|You farm the rock?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008589|There's not a drone, fighting machine, or regulation hairclip that's not made of the metal we mine here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008588|While there are those who tend the land to grow food, we...we...feed industry!|Building up his role
INFO_IKENI7_00008587|Here? We are the farmers of industry.|Grand
INFO_IKENI7_00008586|What are you doing out here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008585|It's not safe around here. Trust me, you've got to watch your step.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008584|Whoa, whoa, watch yourself there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008579|So, that should be enough to hide who I am.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008578|Let's get this escape underway.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008577|You did it, you got them! Hah, then they mustn't have got into your head yet. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008576|I have the things you need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008574|I can't escape in this clothing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008573|And, if you can get me some clothing from the merchants in the miners' quarter, that should help me get out without being noticed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008572|It's bound to be guarded though so be careful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008571|They store anything they confiscate in there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008570|Well, my axe would be useful. I'll bet it's being stored in the House of the Suggestors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008569|Is there any equipment you need to help your escape?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008568|Get me that and we can move forward from there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008567|But, that's not your problem, I suppose. I can handle that if you can get me a weapon and a disguise.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008566|Only problem is ...he's already one of them. He thinks he's a fucking Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008565|I've got to get my friend Wolf out of here, somehow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008564|First thing, it can't be 'my' escape. I want to get my friend out of here too.|He's lying throughout this, he actually wants to kill his friend.
INFO_IKENI7_00008563|You must have some ideas.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008562|So, about your escape...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008561|You think on that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008558|We're all dealing with the same shit you know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008557|You know, too many people say that. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008556|Deal with your own problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008555|Maybe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008553|But, I hope you can see that what these Clerics say about 'Free People' is bullshit. They don't care about freedom, they want to brainwash you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008552|Expect? I don't expect anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008551|And, you expect me to help you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008549|I won't let them turn me into some mindless slave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008548|Not yet. I just know I have to get out of here!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008547|Plan? I don't have a plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008546|But, you do have a plan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008545|And, trust me, they won't let you off their leash just because you swear loyalty to them. No chance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008544|These bastards have eyes everywhere ...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008543|Unsuccessfully...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008536|They ambushed us out there then dragged us to Ignadon after we'd been wounded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008533|The idiots I was with were too busy fighting amongst themselves to see the Clerics creeping up on us. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008532|Tavar. A bunch of these assholes came over the border.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008531|Have you already tried to escape?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008530|Where are you from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008529|But, they won't get me so easily.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008528|I was kidnapped so they could try and brainwash me into joining this cult.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008527|No shit?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008526|You are obviously not here willingly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008524|These bastards have got no right to keep me here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008523|Just get me the fuck out of here, will you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008521|Don't tell me you're planning on joining those lunatics? You can't be that stupid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008520|You and your whole faction can drop dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008519|Come on, there's no love lost between you Berserkers and the Clerics! Help me out of here!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008518|Are you planning to get me out of here with a magic trick, or are you going to break me out of here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008517|What? Are you enjoying the view?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008516|Did the Clerics force you to come here, or did the Duke throw you out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008515|And you? What about you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008514|They should all rot, every last one of them. Can't you see the truth about them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008513|Those self-righteous bastards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008512|Now, do us both a favor and leave. This area is off limits.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008511|I draw strength from Calaan. A prayer break in the night is enough to keep me going for the rest of the day.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008509|It's my life. I guard here, I keep the archive safe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008507|You must be dedicated to do this role.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008506|Study and duty, are the foundation of faith.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008505|You haven't made yourself unpopular with the archivists yet, after all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008504|You need to leave. Immediately.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008503|Hey! You aren't permitted here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008502|Please, I have study to complete.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008501|Get out!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008500|Why are you bumbling around here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008499|This is a place of study, be respectful!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008498|What are you doing here? Please leave, now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008497|What are you doing lingering around here? This is a place of study.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008496|Quiet, please. This is a place of study.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008495|You need to leave, now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008494|Who are you? This is authorized personnel only.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008493|Silence!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008492|Please, enter. But, I beg you, do not disturb the archivists. Remember, silence is a virtue.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008491|It seems you are authorized.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008490|Hmm, you're right, but I don't remember seeing your name on the list beforehand.|Surprised
INFO_IKENI7_00008489|We will see. One moment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008488|What? No, you just need to be authorized.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008487|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008486|Let me through.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008484|Is there a special password?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008483|Because, I am authorized to enter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008482|Because, I am a Cleric, a member of your order.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008481|The Archives are restricted. Why should I let you enter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008480|Calaan bless your path.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008479|Then don't let me keep you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008478|And, unless you're worthy, you aren't coming in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008477|Here the worthy learn.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008476|Here the worthy study.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008475|Forget it. I was about to go anyway.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008474|Get out of the way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008473|What wisdom?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008472|The archives are sacred stores of knowledge. Our faith preserves us and we preserve the wisdom of our ancestors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008471|Halt. State your business. Only officially authorized personnel may enter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008470|That is the least I can do for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008469|Oh, yeah. If I find anything interesting in these writings I will let you know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008467|I hope you are satisfied with that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008466|Thank you. Thank you thank you, thank you...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008465|Well, I don't have much. If you did this for money...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008464|Just try it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008463|I can't value what you did for me in shards. This work is priceless.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008462|You really did me a big favor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008461|That will do.|humane minus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00008460|If that is the case, then pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008459|Unbelievable. Now, I can finally read the Arvid's original texts.|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00008457|I have what you wanted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008456|Thank you. This is one mystery I can't wait to solve.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008455|I will get you the book from the archives.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008454|Since you took care of that last bit of trouble so easily, you shouldn't have any trouble with the guard, so try your luck there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008453|But. the simplest and most obvious solution is for you to join the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008452|Or, you could access the security console and put your name on the access list.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008451|That might take a few hours, and I, personally, have never seen him leave his post.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008450|You could watch to see when Karl, the guard on the archives, leaves his post.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008448|I've been thinking about that and there are three ways.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008447|So, do you think you can get into the archives and get it for me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008446|Any suggestions for how I get into the archives?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008445|Maybe, it's nothing, but...I can't let it go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008444|But, I would like to learn that for myself instead of having it spoon-fed to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008443|They say we are missing the 'necessary vision' to understand his divine message.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008442|Because, we are to serve Calaan in combat and not to interpret his words.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008441|Why is this book so secret?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008440|And, that bugs me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008439|There has to be a written copy, or a recorded copy somewhere, it's just not available to us out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008438|All that I want is a copy of Arvid's teachings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008437|No. Well, yeah, that would be great, but for now I just need a book.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008436|So, you need access to the archives?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008435|Concentrate on what's right here, right now', they told me. 'It is only possible to change the future if you draw the correct conclusions from the past', they said.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008434|But, will they let me in the archives to study his writings? No. I sneaked in, they threw me out. I was lucky to avoid re-education.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008433|And, I can't work out why.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008432|But, there's something about Arvid, something about those early works that doesn't make sense.|Getting worked up
INFO_IKENI7_00008431|Oh, yeah! He is the founder of our order, the reason why the Clerics exist.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008430|I am surprised, but you probably only know the basics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008429|No, should I have?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008428|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008427|Have you ever heard of Prophet Arvid?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008426|Tell me your problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008425|Which brings me to you. I'm betting you have answers and I'm betting you're the curious type.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008424|I mean knowledge is wisdom. Wisdom brings you closer to Calaan. So, what's wrong with getting some answers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008423|They want logic, straight answers, they forbid anyone from looking deeper into things. And, that's crazy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008422|You know, there is a reason why I wanted to talk to you. For all the thirst for knowledge in this place people can be a little...focused.|Enthused
INFO_IKENI7_00008421|I can understand that. This is a small place, secrets don't stay secret here long.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008420|Oh. You're the mysterious type.|Unmoved
INFO_IKENI7_00008419|Really? Well, you wouldn't be the first person who didn't want to see the truth about themselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008418|Ha. I knew it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008417|You're right, I don't need assistance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008416|You're wrong, I'm here for Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008415|Keep your questions to yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008414|And, you don't look like you're here to ask for divine assistance. Am I right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008412|I can spot the devout.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008411|You didn't come here to pray, did you?|Curious - realising the player is not there to pray
INFO_IKENI7_00008410|I... I don't know who I am anymore.|Scared
INFO_IKENI7_00008408|Now, it flows through my skull.|Scared
INFO_IKENI7_00008407|I am... I...I remember sand. Lots of sand.|Trying to remember
INFO_IKENI7_00008406|Who are you exactly?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008405|Skyler is not at home right now...|He's totally confused.
INFO_IKENI7_00008404|I will leave now, as you ordered. As the voice says.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008402|They took everything there!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008401|Listen, search the dungeons of the ruins.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008400|I heard a few bones breaking. Maybe you are telling the truth. |Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00008399|You can get out of here. The reaver leader is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008398|Now the worms eat him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008397|He jumped headfirst from the balcony.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008396|But, I obeyed. My friend did not obey.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008395|Beetles for appetizers, worms for the main dish.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008394|With a club to the head. Then rotting stone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008393|How did you get captured?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008392|If you kill me then you are killing your dreams!|Desperate, imploring
INFO_IKENI7_00008391|Of course, as you wish, my lord!|He's totally confused.
INFO_IKENI7_00008390|Oh, they do! And all because I scrub, because I clean, because I will bring you money!|He's totally confused.
INFO_IKENI7_00008389|Someone will pay a lot of ransom money for me! A lot. I am a living moneybag, you understand?!|Desperate, imploring
INFO_IKENI7_00008388|Ransom. Yes...Ransom!|Grasping at something in his mind.
INFO_IKENI7_00008386|You'll have to speak more clearly, I don't know what you're talking about.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008383|Nobody wants to kill you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008381|I am important, I am valuable, you can't kill me!|Stressed
INFO_IKENI7_00008380|No... no! It's not my time, I still have to cleanse this land.|He's totally confused.
INFO_IKENI7_00008379|We've seen raiding parties, but we've hidden from them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008378|No problem. I'll take the food.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008377|There will still be food, just make sure you bring the shards to pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008376|Orders are orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008375|Sadly, this is the last time I can give you something to eat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008374|Thank you. I appreciate that. I hope we can trade with them again. That way we might all start trusting each other.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008373|I'm sorry, that's all I can pay you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008371|I can't believe the price has gone up that much recently.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008370|Call us even.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008369|The food cost me more than that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008368|Think? I watched it happen, as Baxter sent his raiding parties to steal and kill. Sure, the Hort isn't perfect, but they aren't just killers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008367|You think that about Outlaws and you go and join these fanatics?|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00008366|So, can I count on you? Think about it. It's worth it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008365|Tell him everything is fine here. There's nothing to report, the chems must be coming from somewhere else. Simple.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008364|And, what am I supposed to tell Dietrich? He sent me for answers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008363|Nobody gets hurt. The Clerics want this stuff.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008362|Look, all I'm doing is dealing a few chems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008361|We can be partners.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008360|I understand you're lying. You're an Outlaw.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008359|If the dealer's dead, they should stop looking, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008358|Yeah, I think we can sort that, we can use a trick I've done in the past.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008356|Give them the clothes you found in my trunk and tell them you took the dealer down. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008355|I want you to track them down wherever they are, in the Hort, or beyond.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008353|This is what we must do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008351|Find peace in yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008350|Well, that's going to take some further discussion with the Legates, we can't let anyone else get in the same way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008349|He infiltrated the outpost, people thought he was a Cleric, so he was able to continue his business in secret.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008348|But, how was an Outlaw able to do business inside the Hort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008346|And, the insurance you gave me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008345|Then your debt is paid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008344|Now go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008343|And, I withhold any further punishment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008342|I will consider this matter closed.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00008341|Your empty pockets speak of a clean conscience.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008340|Here you can have it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008339|Give me your Elexit, immediately.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008338|You won't? Then you seem to have forgotten about the power of Suggestion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008337|But, make sure you have learned from this error in judgement.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008335|The sum is enough to make me forget your misstep, for now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008334|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008333|Is this enough to cover my debt?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008332|I'm not paying you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008331|And, since you never felt the need to make a donation, you will have to compensate me for this new affront.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008330|If that is all then you can leave. Now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008329|I will reward this generosity with my own and withhold the punishment that was due to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008328|But, I haven't forgotten that you served the community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008327|But, if they were incurred, they should be paid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008326|This job wasn't supposed to involve expenses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008325|I ran up expenses on this job, I'll need those paying back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008323|So, you shouldn't expect to be paid as if you had.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008322|You've not completed the task that was given to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008321|Which brings me to assume you got your hands on this report under false pretenses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008320|So, they've got you playing messenger...|Observing
INFO_IKENI7_00008319|Here, the report from the southern outpost.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008318|But let's get to the point.|Stern, assessing the player.
INFO_IKENI7_00008317|Faith serves, Calaan honor us all.|A blessing as thanks.
INFO_IKENI7_00008316|All who stay here must pay their tithe to honor Calaan.|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00008315|I'm not here to pay anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008314|Yes, I am here to pay my tithe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008313|What brings you to me? Are you here to pay your tithe?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008312|Calaan be with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008311|I'd imagine coming back to the Hort would be a bit different than this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008310|Fear blinds those who fall into its grip.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008309|Stay alert, we don't know when the next attack will happen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008308|My negligence could have cost me my head. But, you have saved me from that fate. Thank you, from me and from the others you have saved.|Ashamed
INFO_IKENI7_00008307|I didn't exactly keep an eye on him. I was just happy another man had been sent to assist.|Ashamed
INFO_IKENI7_00008306|He was? Not seeing that doesn't put my leadership in a good light.|Ashamed
INFO_IKENI7_00008305|Karsten was an Outlaw. He was smuggling Elex into the Hort from here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008303|But, very well, go ahead, search the place, if only to satisfy him. My trunk code is 4979. There, I have nothing to hide.|Giving up
INFO_IKENI7_00008302|Dietrich. He doesn't send me a messenger, he doesn't send supplies, or reinforcements, but he will send an interrogator? |Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00008301|I have a warrant from Dietrich. You are to cooperate with me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008300|Excuse me? What is this order? What is this about?|Annoyed at the interference
INFO_IKENI7_00008299|I'm here on official business. I need to question your men.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008298|Calaan's thanks are one thing, but I know Elexit speaks for him too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008297|You have my thanks. Hopefully now they'll understand what's happening with the Outlaws and that we need help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008296|I delivered your report to Balder.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008294|Thank you for letting me know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008293|And, I thought we are the only ones taking losses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008292|Balder is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008291|I hope he knows what to do with it.|Letting emotion creep in. Uncertain
INFO_IKENI7_00008290|He will know what to do with it.|Military, efficient order, certain
INFO_IKENI7_00008289|Take it straight to Patriarch Balder in Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008288|Here, take the report. Take care of it as if it was your life. This information is needed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008287|You hold our lives in your hands with this.|Serious
INFO_IKENI7_00008286|Give me the report, I will deliver it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008285|Very well, thank you. I will explain what I need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008284|That demonstrates trust on your side.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008282|As a wiseman trapped between two raptors. Logic alone cannot save you...|A saying of Calaan, considering the offer and feeling trapped.
INFO_IKENI7_00008281|You'll regret turning down my offer of help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008280|There must be something I can do to earn your trust.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008279|I agree. Take this as insurance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008278|If you prove yourself, I will return what you give me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008276|Give me something valuable of yours to hold. That will prove you trust us and give me assurance you mean what you say.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008275|I'm not sure...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008274|Trust isn't an easy thing to earn...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008273|How can I get you to trust me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008272|I hope you are Calaan sent... All right, I will take your offer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008271|Calaan give me a sign. First you wreck our communications, then you kill our runner, then you send us this guy.|A hope, not a prayer, he's torn as to what to do.
INFO_IKENI7_00008270|And, it sounds like you're short of men. Do you need the job done, or not?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008269|Persistent, aren't you? But, I have orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008268|Let me do it for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008267|About that confidential job...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008266|But, I can't go trusting just anyone with confidential tasks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008265|There's always work that needs doing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008264|He needs to know what's going on here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008263|Could you deliver it for me? It has to get to Balder.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008262|I need to get a report back to the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008261|Losing friends, fed to that damned Converter tends to spoil a man's sense of humor.|Warning
INFO_IKENI7_00008260|Plenty of men here would kill you for a joke like that.|Warning
INFO_IKENI7_00008259|I'd watch your smart mouth.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00008258|I'm an Alb. |Saying this to wind the player up
INFO_IKENI7_00008257|But not every Cleric is as stubborn to the core as the majority of those in Hort.|Realising it is a valid question
INFO_IKENI7_00008255|I understand. You think I will go and peddle your secrets.|Surprised
INFO_IKENI7_00008254|It is better if you don't know.|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00008253|Welcome to our humble camp.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008252|I'm Dirk, the Legate in command here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008251|I can see now that you are the new messenger, but I completely forgot to introduce myself.|Working this through and coming to a decision, he needs help
INFO_IKENI7_00008250|And who do I have the honor of addressing?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008249|I am Dirk. Commanding Legate of this outpost.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008248|We haven't introduced ourselves yet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008247|But I am going against protocol right now.|Working through his conflict, he needs help, but has orders
INFO_IKENI7_00008246|Do you have work for me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008245|They must still be shorthanded. How are we supposed to fulfil Calaan's Will without the men to do it?|Annoyed. Frustrated
INFO_IKENI7_00008244|No? Dammit, then they still haven't found a replacement...|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00008243|Hmm. Negligence like that does surprise me, but your predecessor didn't exactly focus on glory.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008242|And I travel incognito because it's safer.|Lying
INFO_IKENI7_00008241|I lost my notification badge.|Lying
INFO_IKENI7_00008239|And why are you traveling incognito?|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00008238|Just a moment. Where is your identification badge?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008237|Wait...stop. You are the messenger I sent for?|Doublechecking. Unsure
INFO_IKENI7_00008235|I'm not your messenger.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008234|Ah, finally, I've been waiting for you. Just put the correspondence down over there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008233|So, go ahead, the sooner you're done, the sooner you can leave me alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008232|But, be careful, those things will be nearby.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008231|We buried their remains there, so if you find two graves you are in the right area.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008230|East of our training facility, at the foot of the mountain.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008229|Where were the other acolytes killed?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008228|Perhaps, I should believe more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008227|Wow, maybe Calaan did send you. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008226|All of them, for sure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008225|All of them? Are you sure? |
INFO_IKENI7_00008224|The chimeras are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008223|Our superiors can't argue with that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008222|So, not getting myself killed is an act of faith.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008221|After all, we're short of men aren't we?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008220|Well, Calaan wishes it, so I have to follow Calaan's will.|Working this out.
INFO_IKENI7_00008219|I will kill the chimeras.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008218|We should work together on this.|Working this out.
INFO_IKENI7_00008217|If this is a gift, or it is a test that Calaan has sent me... Then you should come with me to help kill these creatures.|Working this out.
INFO_IKENI7_00008216|I am up next for patrol duty and those things killed the last two acolytes. So...|Working this out.
INFO_IKENI7_00008215|Or, did Calaan send you to save me? I have read the scriptures, but they don't always make complete sense.|Defensive, admission
INFO_IKENI7_00008212|Really? Is this a test? Am I supposed to take care of them? Or, is you doing it what Calaan wants?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008211|Tell me where these creatures are and I'll kill them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008210|So, leave me alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008209|You've seen what I have to hide.|Embarrassed
INFO_IKENI7_00008208|You've already looked through my things.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008207|What are you doing rummaging through my private things?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008206|Take this and forget what you saw.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008205|I collect them. Collect. It's nostalgia. Everyone saves tech stuff, I save...dolls. It's important to remember the Old World.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008204|So, you play with dolls?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008203|Give that here!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008202|I found this doll in your trunk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008201|What exactly do you expect? Do you think I'm just going to pull my pants down and let you search me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008199|But, how do you know it's a search warrant? Can Berserkers even read?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008198|I might not have anything to hide, but that doesn't mean you can push me around.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008197|And, you can wipe your ass with that warrant.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008194|But, that has to be a fake. No one at the Hort would ask an Outlaw to conduct this search.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008193|Yes. But, what does that mean?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008190|I have a search warrant here, from the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008189|We face challenges from the unfaithful. Both reavers and Calaan's lesser creatures.|Standing too attention, official report
INFO_IKENI7_00008188|Learn from action. Action builds experience. |Reciting
INFO_IKENI7_00008187|Fieldcraft training, sir! |To attention
INFO_IKENI7_00008186|What are you doing here, why aren't you stationed at the Hort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008185|But, there won't be any more fuck...mess ups. The weapons have been cleaned and I have studied Calaan's scriptures, sir.|Correcting himself
INFO_IKENI7_00008184|By the infinite skies, I vow that I will be ready for the next inspections. I don't know what you've been told...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008183|You're not? Aw, raptor balls, I was actually ready for inspection this time...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008182|Then stand to attention and look the part.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008181|I am not your commanding officer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008179|I am here to report for Acolyte training.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008178|Sir!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008177|This body better not turn up walking and talking somewhere...|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00008176|You took them off his body....?|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00008175|These are his clothes. I took them off his body as proof.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008174|And, where is the body?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008173|You did?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008172|Yes, I took care of the culprit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008171|But, very well, let's say this matter is closed. And I will tell the necessary authorities the service you have done for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008170|Thank you for your help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008169|He's dead? Then Calaan has seen justice...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008168|An Outlaw, Karsten, was behind everything, but you don't need to worry about him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008167|I am sorry.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008166|I can't give you more than you've already had from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008165|The Clerics have clamped down and my income has dropped.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008164|Well, how do I say it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008163|No partner, no business, no shards, sorry. That's it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008162|Well, as I've heard it, my partner there is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008161|I said come back in a week, so have a little patience.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008160|Whoaa, business is good, but it isn't that fast. Come back in a week. You'll get your payment then.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008159|Of course, partner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008158|Sure, here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008157|No chance!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008156|You want to fuck me over.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008155|And, as you didn't take my offer I'm thinking a) you have something to do with that and b)...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008154|But, I believe, Shorty, my partner in the Hort, has found a way to get himself killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008153|Normally, I wouldn't do business with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008152|Is that so?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008151|Well, aren't you bold?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008149|Now, we just have to get the people who sent you to stop sniffing around.|Thinking
INFO_IKENI7_00008148|I've decided, I'll take a share in your Elex business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008146|Good, then we have a deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008145|No chance!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008144|Just like that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008142|We're not making any deal. Get your stuff and get out of Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008141|Okay, we have an agreement.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008140|I know business is good for you. So, you'll have to pay me more if you want me to stay quiet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008139|And, if you let me keep going, I will give you a tenth of my earnings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008138|Yes, I am an Outlaw, but I'm not an idiot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008137|That's all you want?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008136|You're after shards, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008135|Is this a shakedown?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008134|I'll let the Clerics in the Hort decide that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008133|Part of our job here is reconnaissance, sometimes a disguise comes in handy? Can you understand that?|Annoyed - Are you stupid (he's lying)
INFO_IKENI7_00008132|Why would a Cleric have a set of Outlaw's clothing?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008131|You know exactly what I found in the trunk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008130|Congratulations. Then you can inform the Hort that my laundry is in order.|Sarcastic
INFO_IKENI7_00008129|I inspected your storage trunk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008128|You know how hard it is to get replacements for things like that out here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008127|I would have given you the fucking code if you'd asked.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008126|Hey! Do you enjoy wrecking people's property?|Angry
INFO_IKENI7_00008125|But, please, here. Be my guest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008124|You can check mine. But, you'll find nothing but a few pieces of clothing.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00008123|If that is the case, then you won't mind me inspecting those trunks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008120|We keep things tight and ordered here. We live by the rulebook right down to keeping our storage trunks secure.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00008117|I told you there is nothing out of order here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008116|Well, did you find anything?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008115|Have your look around. Check what you want. You won't find anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008114|For fuck's sake! Then tell them come out here and show me how to do it better! I am starting to get sick of this constant mistrust.|Pissed off
INFO_IKENI7_00008113|The Clerics in Hort have a different opinion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008112|A warrant? What are you looking for? You'll find everything in order here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008111|I'm here on an investigation, I have a warrant here and you are to cooperate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008108|With the danger of the Alb Converters, it's surprising more refugees haven't sought our protection.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008107|Not to just walk up and talk to us anyway.|As in the Outlaws wouldn't have ordered him to come here to talk, they'd've sent him to kill someone
INFO_IKENI7_00008106|Because, I can't see why the Outlaws would have sent you all the way out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008105|We don't get Berserkers here very often..|
INFO_IKENI7_00008104|Or, are you just sick of talking to trees?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008100|What brings you here? Are you fleeing the Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008099|I'll tell you what I know about my supplier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008098|And, don't take the first deal he offers. The guy has shards up to his eyeballs, so you can squeeze him for a good deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008097|Otherwise, he'd get shot trying to cross the border. Find that and you've found him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008096|But, if he's travelling between here and Tavar to keep his supply route open he'll have to have some Outlaw stuff on him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008095|You'll find him at the southern Cleric post. He's manage to pass himself off as an Cleric, they all believe him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008094|He's an Outlaw, a cunning bastard driven by profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008092|So, tell me who is supplying you?|Getting to business
INFO_IKENI7_00008090|In fact, you know, I've had enough!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008088|We've got nothing else to talk about. So, get the hell out of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008087|Well, alright. As long as I don't leave here empty-handed, I'm in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008086|All right, all right. I get it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008084|Okay, let's negotiate. You tell me and I'll let you keep your head.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008083|We're done here until you pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008082|Free? You're not getting anything without paying the shards I need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008081|Why should I negotiate when I can get the information for free?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008080|So, talk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008079|Well, now. Under these circumstances, of course you're welcome to know what I know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008078|I'll pay well, but the information better be worth it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008077|Okay, I think we can negotiate something.|Calm, in control
INFO_IKENI7_00008076|You sure have a short fuse, don't you?|Calm, in control
INFO_IKENI7_00008075|Is this secret worth losing your life over?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008074|And, I'm keeping it that way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008072|Ah, now that's a trade secret. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008071|Where do you get your chem supplies from?|Supplies = drugs.
INFO_IKENI7_00008070|He might be talkative.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008069|And, so? Who was behind this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008068|The chem smuggling is over.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008066|If our people don't cooperate, show them this warrant.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008065|Start there and turn everything upside down if you have to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008064|There's a recon post there in the ruins of an old fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008063|Good. My information says that the Elex is coming from somewhere to the south.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008062|I will find the criminals behind this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008061|Still, you will have to question him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008060|I need answers. We have to find who is behind this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008059|He sounds more like someone low down in the organization just trying to scrape together a few shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008058|Good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008057|Yes, he's dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008056|Then, the problem is still outstanding. You should complete your task and get rid of this Outlaw for good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008055|No, he's still alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008054|But, I doubt he was behind everything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008053|He was outside the gates looking for an opportunity to get in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008052|And, where did you find him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008051|And, this Outlaw has been taken care of?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008050|I have a suspect for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008049|Shorty, an Outlaw trader.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008048|So? Who is this person?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008047|I've found out who was doing the smuggling.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008046|About the Elex smuggling...|
INFO_IKENI7_00008045|I'll be watching you and making sure you stick to the task.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008044|But, this isn't just blind trust and hope.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008043|So, you can't be part of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008042|You weren't here when all this started.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008041|Why do you trust me with this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008039|That will be all, dismissed!|
INFO_IKENI7_00008038|I won't accept a lack of discipline. I expect loyalty, hard work, application and results. |
INFO_IKENI7_00008037|All the Free People need to be properly trained if we want to survive what's coming. Those Albs want to destroy us all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008035|It gives me no pleasure to say that. I wish we could work together instead of being at war.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008034|Remember that if you get tempted in future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008032|Are you with me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008031|You'd be tied up and neck deep in Jackal shit by now if I really thought you were behind it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008030|I wanted to test your reaction.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008029|Without proof you should keep accusations like that to yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008028|You suspect me because I'm new here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008027|You suspect me because I'm a Berserker?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008026|You suspect me because I'm an Outlaw, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008025|You don't have something to do with it, do you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008024|I need to find who is bringing this poison in and selling it to our initiates.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008023|I mean it's a crazy thing to do, but...some people do it to gain an edge but end up becoming addicts, look at the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008022|Some of the initiates have been caught taking chems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008021|Someone has been undermining the training program we have here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008019|What do you want me to do?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008018|You have to stay sharp to provide the best training and to understand our enemy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008017|If we are to work with the Free People, if the Clerics are to save the Free People from the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008015|If you want to progress then that's what I need to see, that's what Calaan expects it is what you should demand of yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008014|I don't train Outlaws. I'm not giving you skills that you can use against our men.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008013|I wish I could. I wish we could fight side-by-side to stop the Albs. But we must listen to our betters and they still see us as enemies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008012|I don't train Berserkers. I'm not going to give you knowledge you'll then use against us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008011|But, before you ask any more questions, let's get one thing clear.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008010|And, I get into the field when I can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008009|I do so every day. And my tasks aren't easy. I take care of internal matters and coordinate training.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008008|If the training is so strict, how come you're just sitting around?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008007|My name is Dietrich and it is my job to ready all new Initiates for the trials that will face them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008006|So, you're here to report for initiation?|
INFO_IKENI7_00008005|But, I understand that shards can be helpful too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008004|I've just got to hope someone decides to take his place soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008002|Dead? Damn it, I've been waiting an age for those supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008001|Your supplier is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00008000|If you can pay, we can trade. That's the way these things work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007998|And, you aren't one of them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007997|I only do business with people I know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007996|You? With me? Nope.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007995|Let's do some business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007994|You are needed elsewhere. So, get going!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007993|And, you know, those sort of threats can work both ways.|Calm, in control
INFO_IKENI7_00007992|I mean, what's to stop me killing you and just taking the shards? Is there?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007991|Strange. I am a hundred percent sure that I'll get the price I want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007990|I have other customers who will pay now, you see? |
INFO_IKENI7_00007989|Time costs. If you can't pay now the price will only go up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007988|You're getting the original price and that's all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007986|I need time to get the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007985|Your buyer will be very happy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007984|And, you can be sure those 'replacement parts' won't let you down. They're top quality.|It's drugs he's selling not 'parts'.
INFO_IKENI7_00007983|There, you see? I knew we could come to an agreement.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007982|Here, take the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007981|Give me another 50% and we have a deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007980|You want to keep doing business like that and the supply will dry up entirely. But...on this occasion I'll split the difference with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007979|You want me to demand that you give me the supply?|As a threat. Playing on the word 'demand'
INFO_IKENI7_00007978|Do you need a lesson about supply and demand, or are you going to pay what's needed?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007977|The rest that came about because of increased demand. Double what you've given me to be exact.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007976|The rest?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007975|And...the rest?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007974|Here are the shards for Godehard's delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007973|Well, you know, some people forget that important part of the trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007972|Do you think I'd be here otherwise?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007971|If you're available, I need you to get over to my supplier and get me those parts. Okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007969|Yeah, of course I have them on me. Packed well and top quality, as always.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007968|But, now I have a question: can you pay for these replacement parts?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007967|Re...replacement parts? Ah, yeaaah, I remember. Those special, particular, replacement parts.|Realising that Godehard has lied to the player about the delivery
INFO_IKENI7_00007966|My life story isn't going to earn anyone any shards, so how about we just focus on business?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007965|I could ask you the same question.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007964|What's an Outlaw doing out here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007963|He needs some replacement parts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007962|What is it you want from me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007961|Okay, okay, we can make a trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007959|Oh, wait, wait, wait, he's the guy working his ass off for a few dumbass robots.|Remembering
INFO_IKENI7_00007956|Godehard? Who's that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007955|Godehard sent me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007954|Because, I have no idea who you are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007953|Or, are you telling me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007950|Oh, yeah?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007948|Are you asking me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007947|You've got a delivery to go to the Hort? Right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007946|I am here to pick up a delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007945|What's up?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007944|I said get going!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007943|So, pick a spot on the horizon and start walking to it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007942|Because, I've no interest in talking to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007941|Who are you? What are you doing here? Blah, blah' so let's skip all that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007940|Listen, I know what you are about to ask.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007939|This is hard work...|Tired with a groan.
INFO_IKENI7_00007938|Here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007937|There, take it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007936|My thanks is worth more than shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007935|But, take this and, just, keep those stims secret.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007934|I know we didn't agree a payment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007933|And, I added a bit more. Just, keep those stims secret, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007931|That's exactly why nobody can know about this. Look, I'm getting the job done and this is how I'm getting it done, so what does it matter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007930|Aren't stims illegal here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007929|Before you start judging me, they're the only way I get this job done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007927|Okay, okay, there's a shipment of stims in there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007926|Now, try telling me the truth. Or, do you want me to report this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007925|I told you, replacement parts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007924|You're lying? What's really in this crate?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007920|Well, even though we didn't work out a payment, I suppose you deserve something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007919|Well, you still need paying.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007918|Was that everything?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007917|I got the blessing for it from the powers that be. The ends justify the means in times of emergency.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007915|I thought you wouldn't take deliveries from an Outlaw?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007914|You came through. If this delivery is all present and correct, it means I can finally catch up with my backlist of repairs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007913|I got this crate from your supplier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007912|He sets up business near the gate during the late evening hours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007911|He's a trader.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007909|Where can I find your supplier?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007907|So, this list has been sitting here waiting to be sorted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007906|With all the mechanics we've lost recently, we are chronically undermanned here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007905|I need you to get me a set of replacement parts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007904|It's not like I have time to waste.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007902|Deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007901|We can get to work straight away.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007900|Then I would be grateful. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007899|It doesn't look like I have a choice, does it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007898|Well, you're consistent, I'll give you that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007897|If you want good work, you should motivate people with good pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007896|And, if I help you for free?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007895|Work for a cause. Then, you'll have a soul.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007894|You just work for shards and that's all you'll have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007893|We're here for the Hort, for the Clerics and for the Free People.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007892|We're not here for money.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007891|Pay me and I will help you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007890|And, it means I need someone to take care of some of the day-to-day things while I get all this working properly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007889|That means I've got to get production running at full capacity.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007887|We are the only ones who can really stop the Albs. That takes a toll.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007886|It is my responsibility to keep things running here. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007885|Complaining? This is telling you the facts!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007884|This isn't ego, this isn't about me, this is about getting the equipment our forces need. You don't think that's important?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007883|Now, you're sounding like a Legate.|Tired
INFO_IKENI7_00007882|You'd have more time for work if you stopped complaining.|plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00007881|Sounds like you think your work is important?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007880|But, I suppose we all have to do our duty if this war is to be won.|Resigned
INFO_IKENI7_00007879|But, now everything we do is for combat. I didn't become a mechanic for that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007878|We used to work. We used to make things and think of the future.|He has a grander vision
INFO_IKENI7_00007877|What's got you so stressed?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007876|If you're willing, I'll take the help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007875|Berserker, or not, We're all Free People aren't we?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007873|But, do I get the resources I need to do the job properly? Do I hell!|Frustrated
INFO_IKENI7_00007872|The machines we build and maintain here. They are all that will stop the Albs.|With conviction
INFO_IKENI7_00007871|I think I will have to get the tool myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007870|Are you asking for my time, or are you here to offer help to me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007869|Then what do you want?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007868|Hold back the forces of hell. And, I'm talking literally, not figuratively.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007867|Help with what? What is it you do here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007865|I need help. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007864|I'd better leave you out of this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007863|Yeah, you have a point, that wouldn't go well with the Legate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007862|An Outlaw? |
INFO_IKENI7_00007861|Why would they assign an Outlaw to help you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007860|You want help from a Berserker?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007859|Stop, stop, stop. Weren't you assigned to support me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007858|I'll send someone to get them for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007857|I'm not here to go on supply runs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007856|And, if you are up for it, bring me a weapons-grade Elex battery, a pressurized air intake valve and what was the last...?|Listing and trying to remember
INFO_IKENI7_00007855|I need an adjustable wrench and a set of retaining rings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007854|Hey, you!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007853|While the other Factions talk about being free, we want that to be true. We want to be Free People.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007852|Well, it works. Shit, you know your components.|Impressed
INFO_IKENI7_00007851|Great, as long as these are the right sort of plastic strings...wires...we should be in business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007850|You mean 'the wires'?|Pleased at remembering the 'technical' terms.
INFO_IKENI7_00007849|All it takes is a meeting of minds, a sharing of dreams.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007848|This might come in handy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007847|Thanks for your expertise. You could make a living at this. Here, I haven't got shards, but..|
INFO_IKENI7_00007845|If you can find five electronic scrap piles then you should be able to find the right plastic, metal string things..|
INFO_IKENI7_00007844|Have a safe journey!|Friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00007843|I have the plastic strings you need.|Repeating the name Raudur used for wires.
INFO_IKENI7_00007842|And, he said we needed those plastic and metal string things you find in machines. I don't know where you can them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007841|I had an expert look at it, he checked the generator over.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007840|You can? You will? |
INFO_IKENI7_00007839|Wires? Shit you know your technical stuff, seems like we have the right man for the job.|Impressed
INFO_IKENI7_00007838|Bit of a drawback now we're out here trying to survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007837|Oh, we weren't salvage collectors. We were Baxter's brute force. We looted, burned, destroyed. We didn't learn about making anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007836|I can find the components you need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007835|You're from Tavar and you don't know how to salvage components? I'll fix the generator.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007834|Plastic and metals strings? You mean wires, right? I can get them.|Realising he's dealing with an idiot.
INFO_IKENI7_00007833|We need some of those plastic string things you find in machines, but I don't know where you can find them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007832|And, that means finding the right components to repair it. But, where to find the pieces we need out here? At the end of the world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007831|But, before that we need to get our generator running.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007830|We need shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007829|Freedom comes with a price, sometimes literally and we're short of shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007828|And, is everything going well here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007827|The only way our dream could become true was to begin our own community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007826|They might offer safety, but in joining them we would have swapped one set of chains for another.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007825|You think the Clerics are free? |
INFO_IKENI7_00007824|You're in Ignadon, why not join the Clerics?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007823|But, these animals are big, I mean b...i...g big, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007822|Oh, we are. We're 'fierce'. F..e...a...whatever, fierce.|Unable to spell fierce
INFO_IKENI7_00007820|I thought you are good hunters?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007819|I secured our storage warehouse with a couple of codes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007816|Are you any good at electronic...things...? Could you sort of 'hack' into the warehouse?|Sheepish
INFO_IKENI7_00007815|Shit, I've lost the codes.|Alarmed, realising
INFO_IKENI7_00007814|So, if I give you the codes then we can...erm|Looking for the codes and not finding them
INFO_IKENI7_00007813|You can take what you need once you're in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007812|Right, so...|
INFO_IKENI7_00007811|I'll get my friend down to this amount, get him to give a discount.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007810|Not exactly, but keep the rest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007809|Is this enough for you to give me the supplies?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007808|But, I'm missing the shards we need. You help me, I help you, you've helped the community, the community... well it'll work out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007807|I told him I'll have the shards by then.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007806|An old friend is coming to visit soon to sell me the gear we need to...you know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007805|So, here's the deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007804|We hunt. We trade. We...you know? We're a community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007803|It's just...shit...I can't trade what those animals have already eaten, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007802|Yeah, no problem, of course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007801|Weapons? Shit, no. We can get them ourselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007800|I'm here to trade, not solve your problems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007799|So, you need me to get you weapons?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007798|We could fight them off with, weapons, but you know? No weapon shops out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007797|Animals seem to want the meat we've got. I mean, big, wild animals.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007796|Yeah...no...you see there is one problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007795|I'll take some. They need supplies back at the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007794|We're good hunters. So, we have, you know, hunting stuff to trade. Food, bits of animals. And, the survival packs you mentioned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007793|Yes, yes, of course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007792|Do you have anything to trade here? I'm looking to buy some survival packs of meat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007791|And, so if you would like you would be welcome to stay and relax here. You can learn more about us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007789|Those men...those men we had to sacrifice so the rest of us could be free.|Regret
INFO_IKENI7_00007788|Baxter was used to people disappearing on raids, casualties, you see? Of course he sent loyal men to keep an eye on us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007787|We won his confidence, persuaded him that we were going out on a raid and we made our escape.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007786|Oh, you don't leave Baxter, you can't just walk out of the door.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007785|So, you left?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007784|That's all that drove Baxter and his men.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007783|Blood, scrap, power and profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007782|Oh, those Outlaws sold the dream of freedom. Then they drowned it in blood.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007781|I fell for the lie that is Tavar.|Bitter
INFO_IKENI7_00007780|It sounds like you had a bad experience.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007779|Now, Baxter's lost his seat in Tavar to the Duke. He'll be looking at getting his Fort back, not worrying about a few escapees. He must have forgotten us by now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007778|But, we aren't those people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007777|There are many who offer freedom...Only for you to find it to be a trap!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007776|I'm not hiding anything. You can see all we have. We came here with nothing. Once we were reavers, famous reavers, but now...Now, we are settlers. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007774|And, have the Outlaws come after you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007773|You're hiding something. Tell me what it is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007772|A dream brought me here. Not any chem fueled vision, an honest dream of freedom preserved. And I want to share that dream with the world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007771|You're pretty friendly for someone who has chosen to live in the middle of nowhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007770|Too many times I have seen people crushed as they watched their dreams die...but, enough of that. What can I do for you?|With a shake of the head
INFO_IKENI7_00007769|I hope you have chosen your life plans well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007768|Of course you do. I hope they work out for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007767|No, thanks, I have other plans.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007766|Hey, I was just trying to be friendly. This might be a community in progress, but we are creating something here that will grow into one of the greatest civilizations on Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007765|You call this rock pile a community?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007764|So, I bid you welcome. And, offer you the chance to stay and join our happy community.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007763|I know it might not look like it, but life can be pretty good here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007762|Vagabond, wastrel, survivor. Welcome to this blessed corner of this world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007761|I am Raudur.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007760|Here amongst these rocks, away from the confusion of unbelievers, here you can be free, at one with the world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007759|Here we are in the most blessed corner of the world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007758|Hello, yourself.|Friendly response
INFO_IKENI7_00007757|Hey, calm down, we are two souls bound by our journeys in the wasteland.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007756|What did you call me?|Aggressive response
INFO_IKENI7_00007755|Welcome, vagabond!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007754|A new wanderer in our midst.|Friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00007753|Nobody should go hungry.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007752|Will they do it again?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007751|I hope that covers what you paid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007750|Here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007749|That makes sense, then they can trade for what they need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007748|They wanted Elexit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007747|Do you really think we're living in paradise today? |
INFO_IKENI7_00007746|I don't believe those who think Calaan sent the Comet to kill the unworthy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007745|You've seen the relics from the past.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007744|There's got to be more than that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007743|How long do you think any of us can keep going if we all just kill and steal and take what we need?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007742|They couldn't supply the whole Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007741|That's what I asked you to do. Can't you see that we all need to be working together?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007740|We needed to build bridges with those people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007739|We needed a trading agreement.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007738|You needed the supplies, I got you the supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007737|I hope you didn't steal them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007736|Nothing. They gave them to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007735|What did they want to trade?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007734|They gave it to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007733|I have the survival packs you asked for.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007732|Anything we can get to supplement what the foraging units bring in has to be a help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007731|See what they need and if we can make this a long term arrangement, right? That will make a real difference.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007730|They've set up a makeshift camp southwest of Hort, find our outpost out there and go north, you'll find them there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007728|They put together survival packs with fresh meat in them, they're hunters you see. If you could get me twenty of those packs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007727|Where are the people you want to trade with?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007726|But, if you really want to make a difference and help us start working together then I'm prepared to trust you.|Weighing the player up
INFO_IKENI7_00007725|With all the fighting, you Berserkers haven't got a great reputation here. |Wary, but hopeful.
INFO_IKENI7_00007724|I want to build bridges between our people, not burn them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007723|That's the normal approach for an Outlaw.|Wary, remembering her past
INFO_IKENI7_00007722|You think I'll attack them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007721|I don't want guns waved around. There's to be no bloodshed.|Firm
INFO_IKENI7_00007720|This will take tact.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007719|I can negotiate the food supplies for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007717|Yes, that would help them and us.|Pleased with her conclusion
INFO_IKENI7_00007716|They could trade with us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007715|I know some people on the outside who haven't joined a faction.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007714|But, you're right...maybe supplementing our supplies is a good idea.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007713|That question's way above my rank. But, I suppose we just can't afford to be dependent on them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007712|Why don't you trade with the other factions to get food?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007711|I'd take that offer of help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007710|I can give you some food from my supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007709|Nutritionally balanced, designed for body and a balanced metabolism. They sort of forgot the flavor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007708|So, we have to supplement with manufactured substitutes. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007707|Ignadon's rocky soil isn't the best for growing things.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007705|Why is the food so bad?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007704|It might not be tasty, but it'll keep you alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007703|And that's if you survive the Albs, the local wildlife, the mutants and yes, the Cleric raiding parties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007702|You mean why am I still not living on the border of Tavar waiting for outlaws to kill me, burn my home and steal everything I own?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007701|Why did you join the Clerics?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007700|Yes, there are some issues. Some of our order are a bit strict to the point of being an asshole and the food sucks, but...at least we're not murderous Outlaws.|But...as in - the faults aren't everything.
INFO_IKENI7_00007699|It was 'join a faction and stay alive', so...glory to Calaan!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007698|Yes, with help from others and our technology. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007697|Do you feed everyone here in the Hort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007696|It wasn't my first choice, but the job came with a promotion, a safe posting and a complete absence of Rippers. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007695|I was assigned here when the last food technician sent a dozen men to the infirmary.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007694|Of course. But, I will have to charge you some shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007693|Well then. If that's so, you can go, so I can get on with preparing the rest of the food.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007692|No, thanks, not interested.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007691|Then come back when you have the shards to pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007690|I hope you've got the shards on you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007689|I'm afraid that will cost you something. We're being taught charity must start at home right now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007688|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007687|Of course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007686|This will give you strength.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007685|I have just want you need. This will get you through the day!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007684|We're still working on the taste.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007682|Here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007681|You will have to wait another day for the next distribution of rations.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007680|You've already had your rations for today.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007678|Good. It isn't a lot, but it'll have to be enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007677|But, you will have to wait 24 hours for another serving, that's the way it goes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007676|I can understand that you're hungry.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007675|Do you have some food for me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007674|The daily rations are free for our happy family of Clerics, everyone else has to pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007673|From now on though, you'll have to fit in with the daily rations. Once a day, in the refectory.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007672|But, if someone's stomach is growling I'd rather deal with that first, then get to the tickboxes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007670|We're short of a lot of things, which means rationing, which means paperwork, blah blah.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007668|I know. Even the miners are complaining that the food is getting worse.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007667|Maybe, if we teamed up with the Berserkers we could get some shipments of fresh food, but for now, it's all I can offer. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007666|You want me to keep food secret?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007665|That stuff looks inedible.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007664|How long have you been in charge of the refectory?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007663|Just don't tell anyone, all right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007662|Here. Take this. It looks like you could use it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007661|You look like you've walked through the whole Alb war to get here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007660|Where did they pick you up?|Shocked at the state of the player
INFO_IKENI7_00007659|You earned it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007658|Here, this is the least you deserve.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007657|And ,I'll tell you, that doesn't make the best stew you've ever eaten.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007656|We were pretty much down to eating tree bark.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007655|They agreed? That's excellent news.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007654|The farm to the northeast will trade supplies with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007653|Then there goes our additional food supply..|
INFO_IKENI7_00007652|The farmer Emmet is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007651|Good luck dealing with the negotiations.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007650|I hope your journey goes well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007649|I am glad to hear that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007648|Please, take this to cover your travel costs and take care of this negotiation for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007646|How am I supposed to survive the journey to them. And what will happen to the farm while I am gone?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007645|No. You need to negotiate the rest with them yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007644|I will tell them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007643|Tell them I'll give them the food they want if they will help us defend the farm against the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007642|It would put us in a better than the position we're in now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007641|Very well, that could be done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007640|No, they are interested in trading for food.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007639|Trade? Or, are do they want to follow the Clerics' example and take what we have?|Wary
INFO_IKENI7_00007638|I've spoken to a group of Berserkers who would trade with you if you're interested.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007637|Damn them and their god. They talk of peace and then they go and do something like that?|Angry
INFO_IKENI7_00007636|They killed the farmer and made the land their base.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007635|Taken? They're holding it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007633|The farm in the northeast has been taken by Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007632|I don't know what you're talking about.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007631|But, your guilt is clear.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007630|Yes. I know you killed him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007628|Now you'll pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007627|And so, you die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007626|Guess you'll die an honest death.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007625|I was expecting more troll shit before we got to the truth.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007624|Well, you have my respect for your honesty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007623|Yes. I killed your brother.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007622|And, I assume you've already made up your mind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007621|I'm not admitting anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007620|And, I assume you are pleading guilty to killing him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007619|Fault? He was following orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007618|Your brother's death was his own fault.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007617|Well, if that's your idea of justice, then that's what needs to happen to you too, doesn't it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007616|Your brother was a murderer. He deserved to die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007614|Hey! You're not getting away from this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007613|I came to find out why. That farmer didn't want to talk, even when we started to take body parts off him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007612|He was to supposed to send a message when that was done, but no message.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007611|My brother's dead, you shitbag!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007609|He caved in the end and the last thing he stammered was that somebody matching your description helped him kill my brother.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007608|My brother was ordered to come here and seize this farm.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007607|Fuck off?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007606|Then allow me to jog your memory.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007604|Why don't you just fuck off?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007603|I don't know anyone called Richard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007602|And we haven't finished yet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007601|We set an example.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007600|They must have had help and I am guessing you were it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007599|These farmers would never have been able to kill my brother Richard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007598|Don't pretend you don't know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007597|Whose brother? What are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007596|What happened here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007595|I wouldn't have thought I could avenge my brother Richard so quickly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007594|Well, here comes the missing piece of the puzzle.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007593|Sometimes when you think things are just getting worse, somehow it all comes together and sorts itself out. Of course other times it just goes to shit, but let's be optimistic, hey?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007592|I am sure we can all profit from this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007591|If you talk to him for us, I'll pay you for it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007590|A farmer, he's called Emmet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007589|If you manage that, I'll send word to Goliet and arrange a payment in Elexit for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007588|Find out if he will trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007587|Very well, we can take care of the raiders if they take care of the supplies we need.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00007586|You know your way around the area. We're in the shit, you can pull us out. Please, just do us this favor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007585|Will you do it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007584|Well, an intermediary then. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007583|Why should I help you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007582|Neutral? I am just as neutral as you are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007580|Couldn't you handle that for us, as a neutral messenger, so to speak?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007579|But what?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007578|I could, but...|Considering, concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00007577|You should speak to the head farmer yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007576|The farm is being targeted by Clerics. They need protection.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007575|If so, we could make a deal that will help us both.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007574|See if they will supply us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007573|Then speak to them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007572|Here, take them back then. I don't want your charity.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007571|Hey, I didn't beg you for the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007570|You need the shards more than me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007569|Well, your thanks leaves something to be desired.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007568|Are you after a favor, is that it?|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00007567|Have you got a bad conscience, or something? Why are you throwing us your shards?|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00007566|Well...that's not what I expected?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007565|Here, buy your people something decent to eat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007564|Though traders charge so much, we'll probably only be able to afford a few root vegetables.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007563|We will have to hope enough traders come through to make up the shortage.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007561|That's Abessa. Every time you think you have a solution...|Philosophical
INFO_IKENI7_00007560|We can't afford to get into a fight with the Clerics over food supplies, there is too much at stake here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007559|Clerics? Damn, then I guess we lost those supplies as well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007558|The farm has fallen into the hands of Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007557|Damn it. We don't have the resources to take it over ourselves. I guess we'll just have to wait for Goliet to remember we're here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007556|And there's no one to take it over?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007555|The farm has no owner. The farmers are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007554|The farmers there really need the trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007551|I did find a few shards he had stashed away. Here, take them as thanks for your news.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007550|Here, please take this as thanks for your help getting me out of Edan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007549|I couldn't really talk to you in Goliet, everything moved so quickly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007548|I was hoping I would find you here one day!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007547|I've not been there myself, I only know of it because our patrols have scouted it. Do you think the farmers there would supply us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007546|Yes. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007545|To the northeast, you mean the one near the border to Ignadon?|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00007544|There's a farm in northeastern Abessa that might be suitable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007543|Do you know of anywhere that might be able to supply us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007542|All that means we have to find another place where we can get the rations we need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007541|The deliveries from Edan have pretty much stopped and the food we've been getting from the farm up north, well the supplies haven't been reliable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007540|That's let us short of food.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007539|We're hard pressed to defend the site and we have to do recon and supply runs on top of that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007538|Well, we're stuck out here in dangerous territory.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007537|We're short of supplies you see.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007536|As soon as possible.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007535|What is it you need?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007534|Do you need help right now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007533|You've seen how shorthanded we are here. We just need a bit of assistance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007532|Would you be willing to help me out with a few things?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007531|You seem to be able to know your way around here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007530|Hey, I could do with your help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007528|I didn't want them dead!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007527|You consider that a peaceful solution?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007526|I've heard rumors that their supply party is already on their way here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007525|I suspect they will be here soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007523|But, their demands have gone up and they come more often.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007522|But, I suppose I don't have any choice. So, go. Appeal to their good will and we'll see who knows the Clerics best.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007521|It's more likely they'll order you back here to punish me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007520|Then you have a lot to learn about your own people.|Thinking the player is naïve
INFO_IKENI7_00007519|You believe that?|Thinking the player is naïve
INFO_IKENI7_00007518|They will listen to a fellow Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007517|They don't care that I can barely provide for my own people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007515|Then the reavers came, so we had to reinforce it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007514|We only built the palisade to keep the mutants out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007513|I want my peace back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007510|But, I can't tell the difference between good and bad plants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007509|Detlef gives help. Detlef is a labor-rer. Oookay.|Getting the word laborer incorrect.
INFO_IKENI7_00007507|Better for me that they don't know my plans until after I've gone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007506|No. He will figure that out when I am long gone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007505|Do you want me to tell Thorgal you won't want to work for him anymore?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007504|Take a look around.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007503|What do you have to offer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007502|Food, is one thing we do have if you want to trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007501|Well, we can find something from our stocks|
INFO_IKENI7_00007500|You must be here to top up on your food supplies, huh?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007499|Their sacrifice saved my life, but it just goes to show. Goliet orders people to do stupid things and people die because of it. I want my freedom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007498|Those Warriors are now rotting somewhere out there. Or deep in the bellies of the beasts that attacked us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007497|I hope we have a deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007496|You can have every shards I've saved if it will get me to Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007495|Get me the supplies and they are yours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007494|If you want me to get your supplies, you'll have to pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007491|We don't have the manpower to patrol outside the palisade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007490|I don't know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007489|Anything happening around here that I should know about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007488|Keep your eyes peeled. Things get dangerous quickly here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007487|Just, please don't take anything from the main house.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007485|Well, you can have a look round the buildings here. Take what you think you can sell, that will be the only Elexit we can give them.|Thinking it through
INFO_IKENI7_00007484|Pay? I hardly have any shards myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007483|The Clerics will only leave if you pay them compensation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007482|Farewell.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007481|I hereby swear to leave this place alone.|Over the top
INFO_IKENI7_00007479|That amount will cover the supplies we need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007476|I hope these shards put an end to this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007475|If the amount was right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007474|If the amount you offered was enough. Yes, I'd consider that.|Considering.
INFO_IKENI7_00007473|You won't get a single shard from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007472|Then if I pay you, will you leave?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007471|There is nowhere else. There is here and here only, unless we pay for the supplies and I don't find that appealing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007470|Why don't you look for food somewhere else?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007469|We need this property. We require this food.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007468|Of course they don't. But, the path of the just requires tribute.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007467|The people here don't want any trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007466|Farmers, is that what you think you're worth?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007465|Very well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007464|Then get off my land!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007463|If you don't want the same fate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007462|You see what this brought him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007461|By who? The farmer? Don't you know that Emmet is dead?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007460|I have been hired to kill you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007458|There is nothing for you here. You have already seen all that you should!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007456|But, who knows what revenge they might take on us now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007455|You just attacked them! That wasn't what we agreed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007454|Who knows what your actions will mean for us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007453|I asked you to wait until the situation escalated!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007452|Here, good plants as a reward! Oookay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007451|Here, that should be all of them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007450|That is not good. It is not oookay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007449|Life will be hard without Emmet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007448|They can stay and help make this farm productive, or they can go to the mines in Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007447|And now we must take care of all those who are occupying our land.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007446|As I said, Detlef has had a hard time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007444|You showed a kindness.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007443|Not everyone would have done that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007442|Thank you for helping Detlef.|Humane cold minus one
INFO_IKENI7_00007441|Oookay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007440|The people here depend on each other.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007438|You are fast. Much faster than Detlef.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007437|I've already pulled the weeds out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007436|Oookay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007435|Oookay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007434|You want help pulling weeds? Okay, I'll help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007433|Pull weeds? No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007432|Will you help me? Oookay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007431|I always have to work the field.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007430|Help. Farmers need help. Labor-rers give help. |Getting the word laborer incorrect.
INFO_IKENI7_00007424|Do you need help?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007423|Yes. You said.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007422|I am Detlef.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007421|Who are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007420|I am Detlef.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007419|Oookay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007418|But, who are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007417|Farmers know things. Farmers know plants. I am a labore-rer. I don't know things. I don't know plants. Ooookay.|Getting the word laborer incorrect.
INFO_IKENI7_00007416|Oookay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007415|I had better go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007414|Detlef works in the fields.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007413|So, you're a farmer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007411|In the field, Detlef works.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007410|But, we make sure he's looked after.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007409|He's never been the same since.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007408|He was injured by a grenade when the Clerics attacked us. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007407|Are you talking about Detlef?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007406|Something is wrong with your farmhand.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007405|We'll need some luck to get through all this alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007404|These are dark days.|Sad
INFO_IKENI7_00007403|Reavers, beasts, Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007402|We Clerics always keep our word.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007401|And as a bonus, the same amount on top.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007400|Calaan be with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007399|Don't just stand there! Kill those farmers!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007398|Your approach is regrettable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007397|Here, this is the standard rate for this sort of work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007396|Whatever. What about my reward?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007395|It belongs to Calaan and to all in Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007394|To me? No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007393|The farm now belongs to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007392|I'll see you get your Elexit. I expect results.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007391|If you act instead of talk....|
INFO_IKENI7_00007390|If this farm is really so important to you, you'll pay twice that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007389|These people are under my protection. You're not going to do a thing to them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007388|One more thing about Emmet...|
INFO_IKENI7_00007387|Calaan's will must be served.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007386|You've pushed things too far. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007385|But, what should I have expected from someone who hasn't found any sort of conviction in their life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007384|But, that's Berserkers. Lost in a forest of their own creation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007383|Outlaws are so predictable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007382|But, that much was clear when I saw you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007381|A shame. I would have expected more from one of Calaan's warriors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007380|Further discussion with you will be pointless.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007379|Then you will get what you desire.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007378|Stop this farmer from causing me trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007377|Well, all those who work with Calaan gain reward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007376|You are interested in Elexit?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007375|Make me an offer. Maybe you can convince me to help you instead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007374|This land belongs to Emmet. You should leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007373|I hope you are really here to make sure that this area falls under the control of Calaan's people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007372|I hope you know what you've got yourself in the middle of.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007371|To you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007370|I don't speak with assholes like you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007368|I am here to handle the negotiations. You speak to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007366|And instead, he sends out his lackey. Tsk, tsk, tsk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007365|You see I have a meeting arranged with him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007364|So, what's your interest in Emmet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007362|And he chose a rat from the desert?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007361|And ask yourself if now could now be a good time for you to rethink your reasons for coming here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007360|And it's a Berserker. What are you doing so far from home?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007359|And he chose an outcast, someone unable even to find a faction to take them.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00007357|And a brother of the faith, well, isn't that is thought-provoking?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007356|Ah... Emmet has found himself find a guard.|Realising
INFO_IKENI7_00007355|Who are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007354|Leave, you have no business here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007353|But, Calaan has spoken and I am the one who makes things happen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007352|You've made your point. I understand. This isn't something that's easy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007351|This farm is ours. This is how we survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007349|This farm, including its residents, is on Calaan's sacred ground. It must be given over to Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007348|Look at me, Emmet. You can see I'm someone who gets things done, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007347|They say I get things done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007346|No.|Scared
INFO_IKENI7_00007345|Do you know what people say about me, Emmet?|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00007344|Good. Cooperate and this will go more easily.|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00007343|Y...yes.|Scared
INFO_IKENI7_00007342|Hello, Emmet. That was your name, correct?|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00007341|If you weren't here then who knows what would have happened.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007340|Here, take what I owe you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007339|Thank you. Thank you, that has lifted a great weight from us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007338|You can relax. You won't have to worry about the Clerics any more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007337|How did the negotiations go?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007336|I was hoping it wouldn't go this far. Oh, I only hope this isn't the end for us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007335|Throw them in the water, or dig a hole.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007334|What if other Clerics come looking for their compatriots? What am I supposed to do with the bodies?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007333|There, that dealt with your unwanted visitors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007332|Make it clear that we don't want to see them, or their weapons here again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007331|Go to them and speak in my name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007330|I want to try and deal this without violence.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007327|I will talk to them and should the situation escalate, you do what you have to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007323|I would understand if you don't want to get involved, but I'll take your offer of help if it stands?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007322|I will deal with the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007321|You provoking their anger. But, I suppose you're right.|Worried it will make things worse.
INFO_IKENI7_00007320|I think they will return for more soon, and I fear they will leave us with even less than they have before.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007319|In the past, the Clerics would leave us a reasonable amount each time and only return once a month.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007317|But, I'll need you to help me as soon as you can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007316|And, as you say, what do I have to lose?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007315|What have you to lose by letting me try?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007314|Force will change their minds.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007313|You seem to be more of a fighter than a talker.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007312|I am not sure you are the right person.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007311|You have experience I don't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007310|In time you will be dead. The sooner you accept that, the better.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007309|In time, they will have to see sense.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007308|Let me handle the negotiations.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007307|You won't be able to keep your farm with words.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007306|My fields are irrigated with water, not blood.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007305|Can you find a solution without violence?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007304|Tell me what you are suggesting.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007303|As I said, I don't want mercenaries. Is that what you are?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007302|I will help you defend your farm.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007301|I'm a farmer, there's no point me pretending to be anything else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007300|I tend the land. I don't spill blood.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007299|I have never used violence in my life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007298|We want to build a place that is safe, there's no safety in bringing men who place their loyalty in Elexit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007296|Trust a man who will kill for shards? |
INFO_IKENI7_00007295|Then arm yourself and fight for the place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007294|Why don't you hire someone to protect you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007293|But, instead of being thankful, word of our generosity has only brought people who want to steal what we have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007292|We have given food to people from all the factions. We trade with anyone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007290|And it's become more than just a family home.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007289|This is where I was born. My father cultivated this land and his father before him. We've made this land grow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007288|Why not just leave and set up somewhere else?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007287|So, they send a patrol every few weeks and they take our stores from us. They're stealing almost everything we worked from the soil.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007286|And it doesn't matter what wall we build we don't stand a chance against their weapons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007284|Then the Clerics came.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007283|Your defenses look pretty basic.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007281|I just want to work my fields without worrying who is going to steal everything I have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007279|Well, I hope for both of us that that's not just troll shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007276|But, apparently you weren't told about it...|Weighing up the player character
INFO_IKENI7_00007275|You Clerics did.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007274|So, if you aren't a reaver what are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007273|Well, I would have pegged you for a reaver, but I see I was wrong.|Considering the player
INFO_IKENI7_00007272|Or, you want to burn everything down with your magic. There's nothing good about your people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007271|You're supposed to be experts on plants, but there you are, all starving.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007270|You, your type. You Berserkers.|Bitter
INFO_IKENI7_00007269|I am not here to take anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007268|My people? Who are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007267|Your people took it all last time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007264|There's nothing more for you to take.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007263|You're too late.|Bitter
INFO_IKENI7_00007262|Take care of him and I'll make it worth your while.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007261|But...but, if someone else were to shut him up. I'd be in the clear and those guards'd be off my back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007259|Those dipshits got themselves killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007258|And now Riley's spread it all round the Dome. He's even got some of the guards believing his yabber.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007257|Parading round out there, hardly a weapon between them. Like they wanted to die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007256|I killed five families out in the badlands.|Boastful
INFO_IKENI7_00007255|That lying shit is telling people I killed a family out in the badlands. Total fucking bullshit.|Annoyed drunk
INFO_IKENI7_00007254|You can have it much easier here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007253|Fuck them and their Laws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007252|They would have exiled me to the Valley sooner, or later, so I beat them to the punch and left.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007251|Fuck the Berserkers, I don't have anything more in common with them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007250|There, that's how we beat the Albs! A word from me and they'll piss their bladders dry.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007249|Ah, a fighter. Let's have you then, fighter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007248|Show me what you've got.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007247|The next round's on me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007246|If you get the next round, we'll stay good friends.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007245|So, what'll it be? Are you going to take it in the teeth, or feed it to the liver?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007244|But, because you're new, I'll give you a chance, one final chance.|Drunk concilliatory.
INFO_IKENI7_00007242|I would have tried that myself, but I if I'd failed...|Tailing off, scared
INFO_IKENI7_00007240|That sort of thing is my business.|

INFO_IKENI7_00007238|But, by the Pilgrim, we will see Amrek's dream become real.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007237|It is not an easy quest that our forefathers have given us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007236|You have your reports.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007235|Take this as payment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007234|In any case, thank you for this report.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007232|Regrettable, but these days that is quite normal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007231|I take it there were losses?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007230|I will send reinforcements and a Cultivator to Abessa to ensure our World Heart survives.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007229|Then replacing him must be my first priority.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007228|The Cultivator was killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007226|What does the Cultivator there say about this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007225|The World Heart has survived, but it is in danger.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007224|The World Heart is being well cared for. Thorgal has been defending it from attacks by the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007223|You did? And, what news? Is he well? Is the World Heart established?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007222|I met Thorgal in Abessa.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007221|Let's see if we can make a deal. Minus a special deduction of course. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007220|All right, let's see if we can both profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007219|Just show me what you're willing to trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007218|Fuck Edan, fuck the Law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007217|I've got a stack of extra work to do thanks to you. Thanks for sticking me with all this extra bullshit. Thanks for that.|Pissed off
INFO_IKENI7_00007216|I owe you, thanks, thanks for helping me.|Grateful
INFO_IKENI7_00007215|But, just water, not alcohol or anything, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007214|I'm not going back there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007213|But, fuck that. Fuck them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007212|I got sent to Abessa with the World Heart, the one to the south of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007211|What is a Berserker doing here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007210|Here, I'll take it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007209|Go on. Go and get it. You won't be disappointed. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007208|You open the crate in the shack over there with it. I don't lug all my merchandise around me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007207|What am I supposed to do with this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007206|Shards to me and to you... your key.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007204|Sure, if you have the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007203|I'm looking to buy a weapon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007202|And, I'll give you a good price. Outlaws need to stick together, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007201|What is it you're looking for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007200|If there's profit in it, I'll buy and sell anything you want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007199|Don't you trade?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007198|Out here? Not really traders no.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007197|Are there any traders out here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007195|You're sure? Yes... I can see you're sure... Why would he betray us...?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007194|My life as an Outlaw begins!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007193|Here, I took this from the Berserkers, they gave me it to trade for supplies, and I suppose now I have, in a way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007192|You don't know what this means. I can get to Tavar and leave the past behind at last.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007191|No, I have everything I need, thanks to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007190|Do you need anything else?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007189|That is exactly the thing I had in mind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007188|Yeah! Yeah.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007187|Here's a grenade launcher from the farm. Is that what you wanted?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007186|That's what I need, that should be enough to keep me going until I can make it to the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007185|Great, that will stop me from drying out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007184|So, can you get me something from that farm? And, make sure whatever you bring goes boom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007182|No, no. I want to get a weapon from those Outlaws. I'm sure if I get something from them then I can blend in with them.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00007180|Can I sell you a weapon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007179|I have the water you wanted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007178|Here are the ration packs you wanted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007177|That won't weigh me down too much. I'd take less, but I'm not likely to find any food until I get to the Fort am I?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007176|I think a half dozen ration packs should do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007175|How much dried meat do you need?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007174|Eight full bottles should be enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007173|How much water do you want?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007172|About the supplies you need...|
INFO_IKENI7_00007170|They are bound to have a weapon that will let me fit in when I get to Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007169|There are some Outlaws there that have taken the place over.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007168|As for the weapon, well, there's a farm above here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007167|The water and the meat, well there should be a number of places you can find those.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007166|Thank you! I need dried meat, you know ration packs. And I'll need water and some sort of a weapon if you think you can get them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007165|I will get you the supplies you need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007164|If I could just get the supplies I need to make it there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007163|But, I know I could earn what I need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007161|I don't have the stores I need to get there. Or the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007160|You are right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007159|You wouldn't survive the journey to Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007157|Then why don't you go to Tavar?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007156|By the Pilgrim, you are serious. All right, all right, I'm going!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007155|Two.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007154|Stop, wait, I...|
INFO_IKENI7_00007153|One.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007152|But, I just wanted...|
INFO_IKENI7_00007151|I'll count to three...|
INFO_IKENI7_00007149|Thanks, at least you have been reasonable about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007148|Here take these shards and report to Thorgal immediately.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007147|Look, if you want me to go back then at least give me a few shards so I can buy some things to make life easier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007146|Hey, hey, calm down, we can talk about this civilly?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007145|Just get yourself back there, or are you going to force me to make this painful?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007144|Now, hold on a minute, who went and made you Thorgal's loyal servant?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007143|Return to your work at the World Heart, or I will kill you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007142|You're right, you're right. I will return to Thorgal now.|Giving up and giving in.
INFO_IKENI7_00007141|I suppose so...I suppose if I can't survive in Edan then Tavar would be even harder...|Succumbing to the Suggestion
INFO_IKENI7_00007140|I know more about Tavar than you. You wouldn't last a week. Edan is your best chance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007139|A coward? Maybe, I...but things have to be better in Tavar.|Fighting the hypnotism
INFO_IKENI7_00007138|You're running because you're a coward. And a man like you would never survive in Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007137|Why should I care about that? They did nothing for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007136|Your people need you. Without your help they will lose everything they have worked for.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007135|Yes?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007134|About the World Heart...|
INFO_IKENI7_00007132|The Outlaws?! Why the hell would he do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007131|Your Cultivator, Rock, went to join the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007130|You do? Why? What's happened to him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007129|I think I know the reason he hasn't returned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007126|I was only just able to get away from them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007125|Let me give you a clue. A lot of claws, a lot of teeth, a lot of blood.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007124|What happened to the escort that was taking you to the World Heart?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007123|Someone else can carry shit for Goliet|
INFO_IKENI7_00007122|Forget it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007121|You're asking me that after you helped me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007120|What?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007119|I don't want anything to do with Edan. I am going to Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007118|He can go and round up a few, ass kissing law-abiding fellows from Goliet to do his dirty work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007117|I bet he does, but he can go fuck himself, I'm not going back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007116|Thorgal wants you to return to the World Heart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007115|We thought they would be able to drum up some supplies for us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007114|The farm Rock went to is below the Domed City. You should look for him there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007113|But, be careful. There has to be a reason why he hasn't returned yet and you might just walk into it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007112|You would? That would be helpful.|enthusiastic, not believing the break he's just got.
INFO_IKENI7_00007111|I can look for this missing Cultivator.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007110|Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007109|I was beginning to worry about the health of the World Heart, but I know he can help me put it right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007108|Good, great.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007106|Rock will return to work for you again. He is on his way back now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007105|An Outlaw? He won't last five minutes the idiot. Oh, well, named Rock, brains of a rock. I suppose he'll get what's coming to him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007104|I will have to rethink how I select people in the future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007102|I wouldn't want to trade places with him when Ragnar finds out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007101|He can't just up and leave. He's got a job to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007100|Decided he...? What the Fuck?|Gobsmacked
INFO_IKENI7_00007099|Rock decided he wanted a different life. |
INFO_IKENI7_00007097|As if this mission wasn't hard enough, now we have to try and keep a World Heart alive in Abessa without a Cultivator. Oh, well, Rock. If it lives we will name it after you.|Frustrated.
INFO_IKENI7_00007096|Then part of our mission dies with him.|Sad
INFO_IKENI7_00007095|Rock is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007094|I really need Rock, to help me look after the World Heart. He's the expert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007093|It's bad enough that the group is missing, but Rock, our Cultivator has gone too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007091|But, instead they've disappeared. It can't be good that they aren't back yet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007090|I sent some of them with one of our Cultivators to a farm near the Domed City.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007089|Ragnar sent the men we could spare.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007088|Your post seems undermanned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007087|Lives of the present, to build a future for us all.|A tired mantra.
INFO_IKENI7_00007086|We've spent a lot of blood protecting this World Heart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007085|The large plant should give you a clue.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007084|Take a wild guess.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007083|What are you doing here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007082|The highest quality rotgut, only available here!|Full salesman/market trader
INFO_IKENI7_00007081|A promise is a promise. Great, thank you. Your heart is in the right place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007080|You need supplies and you'll pay for them. I will remember that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007079|You want to exploit my situation? Then you can forget it.|Put out
INFO_IKENI7_00007078|Pays? You mean you want more than I offered?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007077|I can help you, if the job pays. Really pays.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007075|I'll pay real shards to get more food supplies in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007074|Speaking of which do you know where I can get any food supplies?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007073|It's me that's holding the bill and hoping to get paid before I run out of supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007072|Roaring. Not many people aren't happy to pay on credit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007071|Now that everyone is paying credit?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007070|How is business?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007069|But, who else do we blame? The Berserkers? The Outlaws? The Separatists? Me...I find it best not to blame anyone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007068|I don't want to say it's the Clerics' fault, it's always easy to blame the people in charge, isn't it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007067|There's been peace in here for years, but right now, well, we're all set for things to boil over.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007066|The future of the Domed City is the only topic people are concerned about right now. That's pretty much all of the conversation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007065|News? I presume you're talking about news from in here? I don't hear anything much from the outside now the city gates are sealed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007061|Do you have any news to go with that drink?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007059|Whatever your problem, I have what you need. One good swig will cure all worries and that's guaranteed!|
INFO_IKENI7_00007058|Hey, traveler, is your throat dry. Are your feet aching?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007057|Reconsider what? One wrong word and the Clerics will throw you out of the city, so do us both a favor and calm the hell down.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007056|You had better reconsider this.|Threatening
INFO_IKENI7_00007055|I am on nobody's side. I am just getting on with my job..|Calm

INFO_IKENI7_00007047|I'm an Outlaw.|

INFO_IKENI7_00007045|You have made your point.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007044|Alright. Alright.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007043|I will make sure he leaves you alone for good.|

INFO_IKENI7_00007035|And, if I don't?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007034|From now on keep your hands off the Outlaws.|

INFO_IKENI7_00007022|First you want to fight with me and then you run?|
INFO_IKENI7_00007020|Don't think I'm going to make this easy for you.|

INFO_IKENI7_00007018|I can't tell you how much I need him to disappear from my life.|Appealing
INFO_IKENI7_00007015|I can imagine what he said.|Disappointed
INFO_IKENI7_00007014|I spoke to Brabak.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007013|But, my guess is he must be under the Dome somewhere, shitting himself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00007012|I was too drunk to deal with the bastard. And the guards didn't waste a second to get me away from him...|
INFO_IKENI7_00007011|Well, the last time I saw him there were two of him.|

INFO_IKENI7_00006931|Forget it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006929|Let's get a drink together!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006928|Hey, come over here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006927|What did I do to deserve that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006926|I hope someone does the same to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006925|Great work beating me up. Do you feel big now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006924|And here, this is for getting that bastard to keep his mouth shut for good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006923|Here, this is for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006922|Thank you, thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006921|Well, okay, thank you, thank you. That is what I wanted to hear. Wow, I might actually live through this year now...|Relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00006920|Don't worry, I made things clear to him. He won't be back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006919|Leave me alone? He won't do that while he still draws breath. Oh, please tell me you didn't appeal to his conscience. He hasn't got one.|Worried
INFO_IKENI7_00006918|You needn't worry about Brabak, he'll leave you alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006917|Even if do I think ramming a knife into his guts would be better approach.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006916|True. Yes, you helped me with the regulator.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006915|Come on, I've proved you can count on me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006914|It's not like you helped me with that energy regulator, so why should I believe you'd help me now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006910|But, but...if you do get rid of him, however you do it then I will pay you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006909|If you think you can scare him off so he leaves me alone that would be good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006908|You'll deal with him? That would be great, really great. You won't find me trying to put you off that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006907|I'm screwed either way.|Down
INFO_IKENI7_00006906|I'll end up in trouble with Alois and that'll be almost as bad.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006905|No, no, actually I don't want a Cleric going anywhere near him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006904|No, I don't think that is a good idea.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006903|Leave Brabak to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006901|What a bastard and now he's been dealt with.|Relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00006900|No, Brabak is dead, he's rat food.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006898|Just follow your nose. If it smells like piss you've found him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006897|He is usually near the inn.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006896|Where can I find Brabak?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006895|Brabak is dead..|
INFO_IKENI7_00006892|He's a devious bastard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006891|Are you sure? He could be unconscious, or pretending.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006890|Dead? Really?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006888|Bone breaking bastard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006886|Brabak. A bull of a man and twice as ugly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006885|Who is this Berserker that's giving you trouble?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006882|Even though they know it'll be their turn next and keeping their head down won't save them.|Sour
INFO_IKENI7_00006881|Now, that bastard is focused on me and nobody's helping me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006880|One of those assholes killed my friend. For fun.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006879|And those Berserkers are the worst for it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006878|And staying undisturbed is hard in the Domed City. There's always someone trying to stick their nose in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006875|Yes, for sure. For me at least.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006874|As long as I don't get constant interruptions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006873|Mechanical and engineering genius. I can make anything you need from bootlaces and glue.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006872|What are your talents?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006871|You think it's better here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006870|But, to live in Tavar, you need shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006869|And, despite my talents, I wasn't one of the Duke's favorites, and that made making a profit hard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006868|Flee? No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006867|Did you flee here from the desert? |
INFO_IKENI7_00006865|And, they are still looking for a new owner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006864|Ah, well, I still have them if that's what you're asking?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006863|Tell me about these shards of yours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006862|You know where your place is, so stick to it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006861|And it will stay that way until Alois gives me different orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006860|You don't have permission to leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006859|You only have permission to stay inside the Dome.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006858|Stop right there!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006857|So, here you'll stay until you have clearance from him. Understood?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006856|And, orders are orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006855|You know exactly what my orders are, so...unless you've spoken to Judicator Alois, there's nothing I can do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006854|Judicator Alois has issued orders for you to be kept in the city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006852|Stop, stop, stop.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006851|Still, survival of the fittest, hey? Suppose it's just killed off more dead wood.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006850|Here, take this as consolation for the shock they caused you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006849|Yet, here you are, proof of gods, or luck if you believe in them, that or the sheer blind randomness the rest of us have to put up with.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006848|They weren't supposed to leave witnesses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006847|Well, you were very, very lucky our friends left you alive!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006846|What?! The Clerics trusted you with that job?|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00006845|And I, for one, don't intend to get killed for not noticing their scheming.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006844|For killing people who aren't Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006843|What do you think the Clerics will use that Elex for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006842|So, spare me the morals. A good profit is all we can make in life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006841|You told me you're linked in with the Albs. You show me one Alb who gives a shit about people. |
INFO_IKENI7_00006840|Rich? What's rich got to do with it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006839|That was a perfect opportunity and they missed it.|Exasperated
INFO_IKENI7_00006838|Are you anything to do with these Separatists?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006837|And you go round admitting that? And you're still alive? How did you manage that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006834|Yeah, see? Our little espionage operation is yielding fruit already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006833|I wasn't helping you so you could get rich.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006832|I told them they needed to be heavily armed to deal with Clerics, but would they listen?|Exasperated
INFO_IKENI7_00006831|Dead? You're talking about the ambush group? Who came for the Elex?|Taking it in
INFO_IKENI7_00006830|You won't be getting any Elex, your Outlaw friends are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006829|It was me who took the Elex to those Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006828|Hopefully, the kind made from Elex. What about that hey?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006827|Your 'friends' ambushed a Cleric supply party.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006825|And, you doing your job means I can do mine.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006824|But, here, take this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006823|No|
INFO_IKENI7_00006822|You don't? |
INFO_IKENI7_00006821|If only everyone had the same sense of honor you do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006820|Exactly!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006818|It was the right thing to do.|minus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00006817|Selfless? I don't work for free.|plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00006816|In any case, you can be proud of your service. Your selfless deed speaks well of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006814|I hope the supply party makes it back to the Hort safely.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006813|Good, we need those mechs here as soon as possible.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006812|I delivered the Elex to your supply party.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006811|And I don't want to get killed doing it. My thrill seeker days are long gone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006810|Yeah, just remember to stay suspicious, it will keep you alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006808|And that means I need to be even more suspicious.|Turning a little more serious/wary again
INFO_IKENI7_00006807|I don't really have time for exploring any longer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006806|I wasn't able to take a good look around, but maybe you will find a suitable opportunity some day.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006805|I remember some ruins in northwest Abessa that I discovered. Right next to the cliff.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006804|Besides, I do like finding interesting places, Magalan never stops with surprises.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006803|Because the Hort always needs supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006802|If it's so dangerous, why do you still do it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006801|But, the world has become so hostile with the factions turning on each other. It's getting more dangerous by the day.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006799|I have been to the gates of Goliet, across Tavar and to the border of Xacor, across most of Magalan really.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006795|It depends on what we need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006794|Good luck staying alive|
INFO_IKENI7_00006793|Where do you go to get your supplies? |
INFO_IKENI7_00006792|But with the shortage of men at the moment, I've been pretty much left to take care of myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006791|I normally get a bit more back up though, I'm a logistics specialist, not a combat guy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006790|Supply run, we're procuring stores for the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006789|If it's that bad then what are you doing out here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006788|What brings you here?|Wary
INFO_IKENI7_00006787|But, then you must know what's like out there, or you wouldn't be standing here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006786|Better to be suspicious than dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006784|Because there are thousands of things trying to kill you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006783|Then I hope you have brought the Elex with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006782|There are thousands of reasons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006781|There's no reason to be suspicious.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006780|It's good to see another soldier of Calaan.|Wary
INFO_IKENI7_00006779|We've had enough trouble with Tavar already, Outlaw.|Antagonistic
INFO_IKENI7_00006778|And, keep those hands visible. Any sign of magic and I will shoot.|Wary
INFO_IKENI7_00006777|Halt! In the name of Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006776|It's good you are on our side.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006775|May he look upon you with the mercy he has shown me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006773|The sooner I'm back, the better. Calaan bless you, my friend.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006772|I should get moving.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006771|Good. They need this back at the Hort. I'd better get it back as soon as I can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006770|Here, this crate is all they gave me. |
INFO_IKENI7_00006768|That was the deal. So, if you want payment, speak to whoever sent you from the Domed City.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006767|Payment? We get the Elex and the Domed City gets their combat mechs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006766|What about my payment?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006765|I can find my way back alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006764|Your offer is appreciated, but I am sure Calaan has other plans for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006763|Can I help you get back to the Hort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006762|He will watch over his loyal servant.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006761|He brought you to me when you were needed. He will not forsake me now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006758|Calaan will give me the strength I need, you can be sure of that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006757|You won't get 20 meters in your condition.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006756|Let me have it and I will take it to Ignadon straight away.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006755|Then my first impression of you wasn't wrong, I'm glad they chose you to deliver the Elex.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006754|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006753|Were you sent from the Domed City?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006752|We won't be safe until that has been done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006751|Are you the Clerics' contact?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006749|Kill those Outlaws. |
INFO_IKENI7_00006748|You have my thanks and the thanks of the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006747|Take it, it's the least I can do for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006746|You've saved my life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006745|The only thing that matters is stopping those Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006744|No. My life is in Calaan's hands. He will see me safe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006743|Are you injured, do you need help?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006742|Thank you. Maybe I could have avoided them again this time, but I travel this way a lot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006740|Ah, that's great. That is news to fill me with new strength!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006739|The Outlaws are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006738|They're dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006737|They will be a danger to all of us until someone puts a hole in them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006736|Then, please, finish them if you can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006735|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006734|Did you kill of the rest of those bastards too?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006732|I'm all right. I'm all right.|In pain
INFO_IKENI7_00006731|Calaan bless you, for doing your duty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006730|Dead? You killed him? Then you have my thanks.|Relaxing
INFO_IKENI7_00006729|That was an Outlaw. He's dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006728|For all I know you were the one who planned it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006727|Please, someone needs to get justice for the death of my comrades.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006726|And, I'm supposed to believe you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006725|No, that wasn't me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006724|Are you telling me you aren't one of the bastards who ambushed us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006723|What are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006722|Come on, finish what you cowards couldn't do first time round.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006721|I got away, but I'm sure they're still tracking me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006720|They're probably searching for me right now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006719|I was ambushed, and they're still out. A group of Outlaws.|Wounded
INFO_IKENI7_00006718|No, wait. A Cleric. Thank Calaan for sending you.|Wounded, relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00006717|What, have you come to finish me off?|Wounded
INFO_IKENI7_00006716|Get out of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006715|Yeah, it's been good. Stay cool.|Greeting.
INFO_IKENI7_00006714|This concentration should make for major kicks!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006713|With this amount we'll be able to make a lot of chems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006712|We'll take it to the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006711|What happens with the Elex now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006710|If we are done with the Clerics, then the Albs are up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006709|All right then, let's get on with this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006708|You know I've already got to go and look for one of Calaan's little bastards that escaped, I could do without having to take care of you too.|Annoyed, resigned
INFO_IKENI7_00006707|That's a pain in the ass. You know I've already got to go and look for one of Calaan's little bastards that escaped, I could do without having to take care of you too.|Annoyed, resigned
INFO_IKENI7_00006706|You don't seem to want to be reasonable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006705|You won't get anything from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006704|Just pay up, I really don't want to have to spend more time hiding your body as well as these Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006703|So, you want to end up rotting in the dirt like your friends here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006702|Here, with greetings from the desert of Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006701|Fucking idiots aren't they?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006700|Don't they know that we specialize in explosives?|Mocking
INFO_IKENI7_00006699|Oh, I see the Clerics secured the crate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006698|There, good business and profit all around.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006697|Here, take the Elex.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006696|No?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006695|After you killed them? No chance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006694|Now, give me the Elex and let's get on with it. |
INFO_IKENI7_00006693|What were we supposed to do, waste that opportunity?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006692|We're listening to them, thanks to you, that's how we know about the Elex.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006691|You were supposed to be spying on the Clerics, not slaughtering them!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006690|Oh, and we killed these assholes while we were waiting. Thanks for bringing us the Elex by the way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006689|So, we heard about the Elex you were sending and thought we'd take delivery of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006688|Well, what do you think? It was you who made sure we could listen into the Clerics' radio signals, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006687|What happened here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006686|What were you doing? Taking a shit? You took forever.|Scolding
INFO_IKENI7_00006685|Aaah, here comes our delivery.|Finally! Waiting at the Elex rendezvous
INFO_IKENI7_00006684|Have a safe journey!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006683|I know you've shown that I can trust you, but we have to take necessary precautions given the nature of this cargo. We don't want this falling into the hands of our enemies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006682|We don't want this falling into the hands of our enemies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006681|Not that I don't trust you, but we have to take necessary precautions given the nature of this cargo.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006679|That's why we're sending some of our resources to the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006677|And, we'd like to get them into operation as soon as possible.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006676|No, of course not, but it's enough to deal with their current Elex shortage.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006675|One crate of Elex is enough for a delivery of mechs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006674|They will be waiting near a ruined bridge to the northeast.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006673|Here, please, take this crate and meet up with our supply party.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006672|A supply party has left the Hort. They'll meet you partway.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006671|Oh, you don't need to take it all the way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006669|Because I need it done and you're here. Come on, take it. It's important.|Insistent
INFO_IKENI7_00006668|Give me the Elex. I'll take it to the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006667|Why are you asking me to do this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006666|We'll give you the goods, we simply need them delivering.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006665|You have already proven your abilities, so....would you take this task on?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006664|You see we are awaiting the arrival of some combat mechs to boost security, but the Hort requires some additional Elex to get them active.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006663|Well, that's simple. We need to send someone to the Hort to make a delivery. So I thought immediately of someone with the requisite survival skills, ergo...you!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006662|Yes, Tell me what you need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006661|Are you willing to help?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006660|So, if you can spare some of your time I have a job for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006659|And, those skills you've demonstrated, well I have need of them again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006658|It is you that we have to thank for regaining contact with the Hort. That is a blessing indeed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006657|By Calaan! Then why didn't you come to me before?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006656|Okay, yes, that was me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006655|You don't have to be modest. Your service pleases Calaan and of course I appreciate your work too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006654|Ah, no, no, no. You are a modest one. Come on I know it was you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006653|No, you must have confused me with someone else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006652|You're the person who realigned the antenna aren't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006649|You! You there. I've been looking for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006648|Yeah, yeah. I'm trying to...to...just come back later, please.|Thinking
INFO_IKENI7_00006647|Alcohol and conversation. Well, that and the shards to pay for them. I digress. Go, go now and seek him out and leave me to my thinking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006646|There are two things Vito lives for.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006645|Look around out for the rathole of a dive serving alcohol.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006644|Where can I find Vito?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006643|Innkeepers are known for their chatter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006642|If you feel the need to talk someone to talk go and try Vito.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006641|But I have really given you enough of my time now. I do have to work out a solution to this, this...issue.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006639|Yes, I am in responsible for communications.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006638|Ha, but too late for that now, My concentration is shot now anyway.|Giving up
INFO_IKENI7_00006637|And another interruption. Can't you see I'm trying to think?|Irritated
INFO_IKENI7_00006636|You aren't just a good listener, you're good at observation too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006635|I'll never get anywhere with these interruptions....|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00006634|I will just have to look through my notes.|Resigned
INFO_IKENI7_00006633|I can't keep track of how often we have power outages, or equipment failures these days.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006632|It would just be easier to stay in contact with two tin cans and a piece of string.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006631|Though the condition of this equipment is wretched.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006630|I assume you are in charge of communications?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006629|Thank you for reminding me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006628|Exactly! Yes, exactly!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006627|No, no. Your memory is as bad as mine.|Frustrated
INFO_IKENI7_00006626|Right, so if I take those degrees and...No, no, no, that doesn't make any sense at all.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00006625|43 degrees, eastwards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006624|34 degrees, westwards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006623|73 degrees, eastwards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006622|But...Crap, crap. I don't suppose you can you remember what I said? How many degrees was it?|Returning to his train of thought
INFO_IKENI7_00006621|I suppose I will just have to get used to continuous interruptions here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006620|But, what else would I expect of an Outlaw?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006619|Just keep your magic away from my equipment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006618|I would've hoped a Cleric would've had more consideration.|Irritated
INFO_IKENI7_00006617|No, no. I've already lost my train of thought.|Irritated
INFO_IKENI7_00006614|Should I come back later?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006613|Maybe I could adjust the receiver's sensitivity to...no, no... although... hmm.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006612|43 degrees eastwards, at a distance of 5 kilometers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006611|Just a moment, I have to concentrate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006610|Maintenance is always better than repair.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006609|Bah, I've got that taste in my mouth again like I bit into a bowl of ashes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006608|You shouldn't think that I don't value your service to our cause.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006607|Here, this is for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006606|There are always other things to demand resources, oh well, I'll just have to see if I can persuade the powers that be.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006605|If it were only that easy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006604|I'd recommend stationing some people there to defend the antenna.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006603|So, Xacor's trying to cut off our comms now are they?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006602|The Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006601|You had better ask the Albs that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006600|What do you think? Is the station to the northeast in a good state, or are we likely to get another failure?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006599|We've had to do a bit of cleaning up at this end, but that's a minor issue.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006598|Yes, thank you, we've already started to get messages through.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006597|I recalibrated the antenna.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006595|You just get on with everything else, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006594|Although... eh, doesn't matter. We know what we wanted to learn from him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006593|Although.... fuck that. Were you at least able to find out if he knew anything before he died?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006592|Here, take a few shards and get yourself drunk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006591|I got no idea how to get this information now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006590|Fuck it, he was my best lead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006589|What? Did the idiot piss on the generators or something?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006588|Lutz is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006587|A gift from the Duke of Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006586|By the unspoken laws of Tavar, you shall be rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006585|If he thinks everything's working, he's going to be looser with his talk and that's your chance to find things out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006584|Don't forget to see Lutz, yeah?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006583|Here, by the generosity of the Duke of Tavar, you are rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006582|So, here, a gift in return.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006581|Well, it was a fine service you did for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006580|You owe me some compensation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006579|Alright. I see you've changed your mind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006578|How about you give me the Elexit you offered then we're square?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006577|How about a few smokes? I'll give you those and we'll call it square, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006576|You're going to pay me. Now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006575|You know free from the evils of capitalist exchange. So, why endanger your sense of morals now by trying to claim the vile shards I offered?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006574|Well, you know, when I think about our first meeting, I remember you turned down the Duke's generous offer. So, I assumed you were more of a charitable operation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006573|And my shards?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006572|Now, whatever they're planning, we can be one step ahead of them. You have earned my respect.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006568|I couldn't have got anywhere close to their comms equipment, but in you go and now we have complete access to their network.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006567|I know, I've been picking up their broadcasts ever since you got it in there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006566|I installed the bug.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006565|I had better leave it as it is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006564|There is nothing to do here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006563|It seems to have worked.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006562|Okay, that should be child's play.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006560|And I'll give you a reward for that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006559|I'll plant the bug.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006558|Hey, the Duke already loves me. And I'll pay you, pay you well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006557|Then shouldn't you do it and make the Duke happy?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006556|That will make the Duke very happy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006555|That way we always have an idea what the Clerics are up to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006554|When you readjust that antenna then you can install a little transmitter for me at the same time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006553|I'm supposed to readjust the antennas there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006552|There is a defective relay station between Abessa and Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006551|How are you supposed to do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006549|Here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006548|So, I promised you a reward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006547|Alright. Well, I'll have to try and work with the information I have then.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006546|No. I've told you everything I know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006545|But, we can use this to our advantage.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006544|Yeah, he doesn't look like someone who'd want to go outside the city, he's too cozy in his machine rooms.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006543|He's asked me to go to the communications tower to the north east.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006542|Is there anything you can tell me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006541|Think.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006540|Well, that's a start, but are you sure he didn't have anything else to offer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006539|No, that was everything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006538|Yes, he wants me to help him reestablish contact with Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006537|Did he tell you anything else?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006536|No, no, they've no need mechs for that.. It's clear the Clerics are planning something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006535|He didn't say anything about an offensive. He mentioned defense.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006534|That is the proof. They are planning an offensive!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006533|So, go ahead. What did he say?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006532|Lutz said something about combat mechs being brought here from Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006531|You got me just in time, I was right about to light one up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006530|I spoke to Lutz.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006529|Head that way and keep looking out for an antenna on the horizon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006528|But, it's not just about mechs, its about food and news and everything else, we need a link with the Hort to keep this place going.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006527|I hope that will be enough to fix the problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006526|There will be a device somewhere on site that you can use to recalibrate the antenna.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006525|Here are the coordinates of the relay station that's gone down. It's over to the northeast of the city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006524|Xacor might have left us alone recently, but, who knows how long that will last.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006523|And supplies, we need firepower to get enough food and tech spares into the Dome to keep things going. And that's before the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006522|I don't know, I guess they're worried about security.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006521|But, you can't keep going back and forth for us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006520|Sure, that would help for this.|Unconvinced
INFO_IKENI7_00006519|I could go to the Hort and find out what's going on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006518|We need to get this fixed as soon as possible.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006517|No, we have to reestablish ongoing contact and that means fixing the comm link.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006516|What do you need combat mechs for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006515|That's why we've got to get the link back up now, so we can find out what's going on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006514|But, they haven't arrived and we've no way to check why without communications being reestablished.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006513|He must have heard something from the comms.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006512|Because, he's the guy that maintains all the communications equipment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006511|I need to know what he knows.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006509|And, he's more likely to talk than anyone further up the chain. I want to know what he's heard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006508|Why do you think that these technicians will know about the Clerics' plans?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006507|We're awaiting the delivery of some combat mechs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006506|What's so important about fixing your communications right now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006505|An agreement? Okay, sure, an agreement, as long as you help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006504|You must understand that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006503|We might be able to come to an agreement.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006501|This is for the security of us all, no matter what our faction.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006500|Maybe, maybe not, but you're here and this job must be done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006499|I am not right for this job.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006498|And, if things fall apart here, you can be certain that it will get bloody for everyone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006497|If you don't help us, we could lose everything we have here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006496|I am appealing to your reason. How does it help anyone if we lose our defenses?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006495|Otherwise we are very likely to face even greater challenges.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006494|And, please, please, keep this problem confidential.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006492|You want the help of an Outlaw?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006491|Since you are in the know can you help me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006490|We need to fix that comms relay station before anyone tries to take advantage of our problems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006489|Well, we can't waste any more time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006488|So, the word is out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006487|I just overheard someone talking about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006486|That is a worry, a real worry.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006485|I have no idea.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006484|Do you think it's just one Outlaw that knows, or do they all know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006483|The Outlaws? The last thing we need is for them to know about our problems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006482|One of the Outlaws told me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006481|That is just... Wait, how do you know that? That is confidential!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006480|I heard you are having trouble establishing communications with the Hort in Ignadon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006479|Shit, I can't even sort out the replacement parts until I have this stabilized.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006477|Any accidents are going to be dangerous for me, you and the whole city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006476|So, I would appreciate it if stayed away from my machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006475|You and your Berserker friends. You don't have the faintest idea of what I do around here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006474|I'll have to figure this out myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006473|Yeah, I thought it was a long shot, still...|
INFO_IKENI7_00006472|You are asking the wrong guy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006471|Thanks for the help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006470|Yes, yes that's right. Ah, nice to meet someone who understands this kind of thing.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00006469|If that's the case a three-phase generator would provide you with constant power.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006468|A three-phase? I assume you want to free up a few surge capacitors in the system?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006467|I'm trying to work out whether to use a single-phase, or triple-phase generator for the energy supply system.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006466|How are you when it comes to engineering? Do you have any experience?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006465|I don't care if you are a fellow Cleric, unless...|
INFO_IKENI7_00006464|As far as I know, he is trying to re-establish communications with the other Clerics in Ignadon. While Alois will tell you the Clerics here are neutral, separate from the ones in the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006463|Just walk along the battlement path up at the top, he can't be far.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006462|If he's not on a call then he is usually working maintenance on one of the generators.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006461|Where can I find Lutz?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006460|His name is Lutz, he's one of Alois's technicians.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006459|All that you have to do is get some answers out of somebody and I've even got the guy lined up ready for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006458|So, if you'd like to be that new owner, you know where to find me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006457|I just have a big sum of shards that are looking for a new owner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006456|Problems? These aren't problems. They certainly aren't my problems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006455|I am not interested in your problems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006453|Do that then come back to me as soon as you have any useful information.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006450|Go and grill Lutz. Find out if there'll be an offensive soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006447|What do you expect from me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006446|You aren't simple enough to believe every piece of trollshit you're fed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006445|Now, I can see in your eyes that you haven't fallen for the Clerics' tricks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006442|Don't take that comment on the Albs personally.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006441|We should avoid fighting amongst ourselves until the Albs are out of the picture, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006439|As far as I'm concerned, you can sympathize all you want with the Clerics. That doesn't change the fact that war doesn't help anybody, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006437|I want you to find out information.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006434|So, you want me to be your spy?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006432|So, my job is to find out if he's right, if there is something brewing that could be dangerous for us in Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006431|And, he thinks the Domed City could be the starting point for their military campaign.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006430|And, the Duke thinks they are planning to take control everywhere, sooner or later.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006429|Real business. A proper opportunity. You see the Clerics have had this city under their control for years.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006428|Do you see someone else here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006427|That done, let's get into the real business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006426|What business?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006425|Business? With me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006424|But, if you won't then all the more for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006423|Forget it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006422|Snort it, smoke it, either way, you'll never forget the experience.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006420|Troll Dung, Rat Scab, it's all first class stuff.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006419|From time to time, you need to open a door in your head and look inside, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006418|Well, that's your choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006417|I don't smoke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006416|What do you have to offer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006415|I have the best stuff here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006414|Here, smoke one with me, before you start bombarding me with questions, yeah?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006413|How do people live here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006412|If you end up in the desert in Tavar, you can thank him in person by joining the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006411|Don't thank me, thank the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006410|Thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006409|You should learn to appreciate his generosity.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006408|It isn't smart to refuse a gift from the Boss.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006407|Keep your charity.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006406|Those trees don't hug themselves after all.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00006405|Well, someone has to be.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00006403|I'm a Berserker.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006402|He gave me enough that I can share.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006401|Consider it a gift from the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006400|Here, before you start begging for help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006399|Well, guess you're one lonely son of a bitch then aren't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006398|I'm not in a faction.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006397|I mean otherwise, you wouldn't have even spoken to me, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006396|But, as far as I see it, the way we are now, we should get along wonderfully with each other.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006395|That all depends on whether the person has a sense of humor, or not.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00006394|Your big mouth must get you into a lot of trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006393|Yeah, probably not. I doubt the Duke sent them here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006392|Maybe they have the same reason you do?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006388|Then I guess that's what I have to do. I was hoping you would have an answer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006387|You will have to ask the Separatists, I'm not one of them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006386|Why are there so many of you guys coming to the Domed City?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006385|Yeah, I can imagine.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006384|Let's just say it's complicated.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006383|Okay, okay. I got it. You don't see the funny side, just relax, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006382|How about I kick your ass?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006381|So, a servant of Calaan? What do you do? Wash his ass? Take him his lunch?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006380|Ah, yes. I should have trusted my nose instead of my eyes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006379|Don't you recognize an Outlaw when one's standing in front of you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006378|I am a servant of Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006377|I was an Alb once.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006376|So, what are you? Merchant, bounty hunter or a nobody like most people out there?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006375|Ah, the gift and treasures of travel, for it brings new encounters.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006374|I'd got hold of one recently, but then Hakon spotted it and confiscated it. Do you know how I can get hold of another one? And, if you get me one, can you get me, say three?|Quiet, but insistent
INFO_IKENI7_00006373|It won't be easy task, but I need to get some parts from the Converter that have a high Elex concentration in them. Can you do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006372|Amrek's Paradox. Let's take that horror and make it magic.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006371|You're here to stay. That means you'll have to make yourself useful to this city if you wish to earn the right to leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006370|So, you'll either have to pay a fine to match your infringement of our rules, Or, if you don't have the shards to pay, well...|
INFO_IKENI7_00006368|But, I'll have to sell this stock first, hey?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006367|I suppose I'll have to try and find an alternative contact.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006366|That is a setback...still one less mad fucker to deal with.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006365|There won't be any more. Your contact, Radok, is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006364|I'll want to speak to you to arrange another delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006363|You don't want to run out of shards and end up in some back alley with nothing in your pockets.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006362|I wouldn't wait too long, either.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006360|I need the weapons, he wants to stop me and so we dance our dance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006359|Still, cat and mouse is what we play isn't it? So, I suppose there's no real change.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006358|Where does he keep getting his intelligence from?|Frustrated
INFO_IKENI7_00006357|Are you saying he knows I've found a way to get some weapons?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006356|Alois knows about your weapons delivery. He wants it stopped.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006354|If so, you have my thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006352|And was it you that kept the Seedlings from being destroyed?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006351|He told me he suspected something was burrowing in the cliffs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006349|Please, we need those healing roots to care for the wounded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006348|I've had to put all the Cultivators to work to repair the damage the rotboars did to the fields.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006346|I should have listened to Orik.|Upset at himself
INFO_IKENI7_00006345|It speaks well that you acted without needing orders.|Praise
INFO_IKENI7_00006344|Most stay.|

INFO_IKENI7_00006342|Relax, the rotboars are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006340|These days it seems where there's one problem, there's always four more queuing up behind it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006339|Follow me!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006338|We have to stop them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006337|Rotboars have burrowed through the cliffs, they're threatening the Seedlings!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006336|Quick, quick, you have to help me!|Conversation cam projection, urgent
INFO_IKENI7_00006335|Many Incomers stay to become Cultivators. We always have space for more people willing to dedicate themselves to Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006334|I hope you find your place here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006333|If you would like to see the work we do, you are welcome to visit us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006331|I had better go and check on the Cultivators. Make sure everything is all right. Thanks, thanks again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006329|Then what are you standing there for? We need to protect them!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006328|Rotboars broke through and attacked the Cultivators and the Seedlings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006327|That's why these plants get their own fortified defenses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006326|But, of them all, the World Hearts are the most important. For where they grow, all life will follow.|Reverent.
INFO_IKENI7_00006325|We grow a lot of different plants here. Specimens of all the types we can find.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006324|What's a Seedling farm?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006323|Oh, yeah. Ragnar's always popping in here to let me know his plans. Treats me like a brother he does.|Sarcastic
INFO_IKENI7_00006322|Yeah? Do you know if Ragnar's sent out a search party yet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006321|You're the second person to tell me that today.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006320|You hear an Outlaw's been spotted up around the main gate?|outlaw conversation opener
INFO_IKENI7_00006319|Good luck to him, I don't know anyone who is going to risk that journey in a hurry.|Jora convertor reply
INFO_IKENI7_00006318|You hear Jora's still looking for volunteers to go up to the Converter?|Jora convertor opener
INFO_IKENI7_00006317|What good are walls against raiders? Just gives us a higher place to wave from while they bomb us.|Grim, dismissive?
INFO_IKENI7_00006316|Oh, you know Cran, don't you? He was in here earlier, says the workers are back strengthening the defenses. We'll be ready if those Albs come back.|Starting some gossip
INFO_IKENI7_00006315|Hasn't stopped them so far. They don't seem to care how many of their own kind die. Fanatics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006314|Those Albs got what they deserve. Maybe, they'll think twice before raiding us again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006313|I can never tell if you're being serious.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006312|Cultivators, the shoulders upon which all Berserkers stand. Warlord, or Warrior, we should never forget that.|Overblown praise
INFO_IKENI7_00006311|Hard work pays off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006310|We're getting the Seedlings in. I think the next few crops should go well.|Positive
INFO_IKENI7_00006309|You okay with that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006308|You worry about your Seedlings and let me worry about the customers.|Shutting the conversation down.
INFO_IKENI7_00006307|Since when did Ragnar let Clerics in here?|Hostile, suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00006305|Shouldn't you be finishing that drink there? That would be better than shouting out what Ragnar should, or shouldn't do.|To the BSK, heavy hint to shut the conversation down.
INFO_IKENI7_00006304|Since when does Ragnar allow Outlaws in here?|Hostile, suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00006303|You could do a lot worse for an overseer than him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006302|Born may have his faults but he looks after his people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006301|There you are, I told you you wouldn't be forgotten.|Reassuring, Oran is always right.
INFO_IKENI7_00006300|There must've been some more Incomers join up, we've had some new recruits. We've finally got some help out in in the herb fields.|Starting a conversation
INFO_IKENI7_00006299|Thanks indeed! And where were the Warriors, leaving your Cultivators out there to face the mutants? People need to remember their duty.|A barman commiserating, Oran will agrees with anyone on the other side of the bar.
INFO_IKENI7_00006298|It's hard to say. There were definitely casualties. Thankfully, none in our field.|Still a little shocked
INFO_IKENI7_00006297|What news from the fields?|Looking for gossip
INFO_IKENI7_00006296|Ah, Gunfast!|Greeting the man coming in.
INFO_IKENI7_00006295|You know where to find me once you have secured the goods.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006294|Good, that at least is good news.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006293|But, if chance should bring the contact to you then you should claim you are working on Paige's behalf.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006292|I'm afraid I don't have any clues as to where you should look for him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006291|Then, Paige's death will make that very tricky.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006290|No. I haven't met them yet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006289|You need to do that before the weapons are delivered to someone else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006288|Tell me, did you meet with Paige's contact?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006287|It seems we will have to take more affirmative action over this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006286|You offer them safety and they try to take advantage of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006285|That seems to be the way of Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006284|I am not surprised.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006283|Paige is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006282|You'll have to find Paige yourself. She's a slippery customer and we've lost track of her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006281|Apart from the fact she is one of the Outlaws? No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006280|Contact? Is there something I should know about her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006279|You have? And did she tell you anything about her contact?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006278|I've already met Paige.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006277|So, stay in the city, keep your eyes on the Outlaws and you have a good day now.|General polite advice
INFO_IKENI7_00006276|So, if you want to be allowed to leave, you'll have to take it up with Judicator Alois.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006275|That means you aren't going to be allowed to leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006273|Now, I know you might be pissed, but this order comes from the top.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006272|I have orders to keep you in the city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006271|Stop there and wait.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006270|But, I'll be keeping an eye on you. Order will prevail here. No one can be allowed to threaten that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006269|You had my word that you would be free and so you are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006268|First you break the city's rules then it turns out you have access to funds like this...|
INFO_IKENI7_00006267|Is this enough Elexit to allow me to leave the city?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006266|Do I make myself clear?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006265|You won't find charity here, all rights must be earned by supporting your fellow citizens with work and with Elexit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006264|If I ask for ID, you need to show it to me, or face the consequences.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006263|No isn't an option.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006262|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006260|But, if you want to be here so much then I know exactly what to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006259|So, you are here without authorization? This gets better and better.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006258|You'll have to work, if you want to eat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006257|The guards will block you and I'd advise you not to go looking for alternative means to leave, I will only send the guards out to bring you back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006256|I forbid you to leave the city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006255|This will have consequences.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006254|First you go against my wishes then I find you're carrying this fake.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006253|I thought so. You didn't get this ID legally.|Considering the ID
INFO_IKENI7_00006252|But, if you aren't willing, or able to help me, then you should go and leave me to get on with my work.|Tetchy
INFO_IKENI7_00006251|Seeing as that's valid, I will have to let you go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006250|Well, it looks all right.|Considering the ID
INFO_IKENI7_00006249|I don't have an ID card.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006248|Here it is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006247|Show me your ID.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006246|Newcomers, why do you cause so much trouble?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006245|I gave you the shards you needed to do the job and this is how you repay my trust?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006244|Didn't you promise to help me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006243|I needed to stop those weapons getting out into the city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006242|If I was to say that, then what would you say?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006241|And, what if I was to say that I have to find someone who can enter and leave the city freely.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006240|What if I was to say that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006239|Let's say they have weapons and need shards. And that they also have the business acumen of a stunned troll, so they need a salesperson, me for example.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006238|Good luck!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006237|Calaan's will be done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006236|Calaan's will determines where mercy falls.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006235|But Calaan knows.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006234|The loss of our Regent, should have been prevented.|Upset
INFO_IKENI7_00006232|And he paid the price with blood.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006231|If you need something from him, you should speak to him now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006230|We're leaving this position as soon as the troop commander gives the signal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006228|May Calaan guide your path in safety until the Albs are defeated.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006227|Now, it is time to take the fight to Xacor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006226|Separatist, or Alb, they're all impure. |
INFO_IKENI7_00006225|He ran. That dog really believed he could get away from us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006223|Here. A symbol of his mercy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006222|Calaan's will has been carried out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006221|Now, the Alb is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006220|Well cleaned. You won't find a drop of their blood on them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006219|Not that either of those things helped these Clerics keep their lives.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006218|Still, if you have information to give me, that would be useful. Information and shards are what an Alb needs to survive in the lands of the Free People.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006216|And, I wish to remain so.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006215|Good. That would benefit neither of us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006214|I'm not here to fight you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006212|That must mean you are my enemy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006209|The dangers that we Separatists face are increasing every day and the followers of Calaan offer us nothing but threats.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006208|So, when they do let someone in, it does make me wonder who they are and why the Clerics thought letting them in was a good idea.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006207|I also have something that should please the woman from the Domed City.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006206|I will arrange to deliver the rest to her in due time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006205|It should be enough for her to start her plans.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006204|Here, give her this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006203|I remember she was interested in the weapons I have for sale.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006201|But, you must mean the woman from the Domed City.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006199|Paige. Do I know Paige? Faces and names of the Free People, they merge into one.|Trying to remember
INFO_IKENI7_00006198|Loyalty is what will save us from the Free People.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006197|Let us hope the stench of these bodies makes the rest of his followers think before they challenge the Separatists.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006196|And, there is no sign of their so-called god.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006195|Loyalty should be rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006193|The Clerics lie in the dirt.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006192|Paige sent me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006190|It's good you aren't one of them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006189|Good. Then let us send Calaan his followers!|
INFO_IKENI7_00006188|You can count on me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006187|For if you don't stand with me...|
INFO_IKENI7_00006186|You disappoint me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006185|This is none of my business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006184|Quickly, decide. Will you stand with me in battle?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006183|It seems there are two followers of Calaan nearby who are anxious to see their god in person and I must send them on their way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006182|But, I have business to conclude before we speak.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006181|Logic will always show the way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006180|Then your sense of duty will lead you to your death.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006179|I am a Cleric, they are now my people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006178|I make my own decisions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006177|What does that mean for you? Are you bound to the ways of the Clerics?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006176|Well, I killed two. There are two others nearby who are prolonging their lives by hiding.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006175|I was left with no choice but to kill them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006174|They're fanatics. They attacked me without question.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006173|Tell me about the fight with the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006170|I have travelled alone since I left Xacor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006169|The weapons of my enemies. Never used, dropped once.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006168|You should remember where you come from.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006167|Scare? That's an emotional response.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006166|Your threats don't scare me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006165|What can you offer me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006164|Have you come here to die like the Clerics that I just killed, or are you here to trade?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006161|You once possessed great Elex abilities didn't you?|Assessing the player character.
INFO_IKENI7_00006160|You wouldn't be the first to come here looking for shelter only to end up bowing down to Calaan.|With a sneer
INFO_IKENI7_00006159|I'd watch out, they're probably trying to recruit you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006158|Here, this is for getting your feet sore and arranging the deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006157|People just aren't feeling safe right now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006156|If you'd brought spitballs and blowpipes, I'd find someone to buy them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006154|Good, I was hoping for some higher caliber stuff, but this will do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006153|You are back in business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006152|With luck he'll still be out there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006151|He mentioned an abandoned wind turbine.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006150|Up in the highlands. When we last spoke he told me he was going to head over to the northeast.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006149|Where can I find Radok?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006148|He wants to sell the weapons but you'll have to work on him, okay? He won't just hand them over.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006147|But, he has the weapons and he likes trade. I think he likes trade. It's hard to tell.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006146|Leave the city and find a Separatist called Radok. I think he's a Separatist. But, whatever he is, he's a mad fucker. I can't make sense of most of what he says.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006145|So, this is what you need to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006144|Right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006143|Good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006142|It will do. Just remember, you only get this back if you deliver on your promise.|Considering the shards
INFO_IKENI7_00006141|Is that security deposit enough to trust me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006140|You'll have to show me that I can trust you. How about...How about you give me a down payment, a sort of security deposit and I'll go with that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006139|You? A Cleric?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006138|I could help you get your weapons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006136|Not from Tavar, obviously, they've blocked that route. Let's say I could get some weapons from the these Separatists, for example.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006135|Still, let's say he's right. And that I could get hold of supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006134|Well, he always was the most paranoid of them all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006133|Does he now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006132|Yes, yes I could.|Assessing the player character.
INFO_IKENI7_00006131|I'm not going to argue with you on that.|Resigned
INFO_IKENI7_00006130|What else did you expect? You've been stupid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006129|Sounds like you could use some help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006128|Alois knows you are expecting a new delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006127|As soon as you get those weapons or any information, just make sure you bring them to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006126|They call it neutrality, but I say it's oppression.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006125|But, the Clerics want to keep all the guns for themselves and screw the rest of us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006124|I mean, what? Are we supposed throw rocks at the Albs when they attack?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006123|But, this is about self-defense. The only person who can stop a person with a gun is a person with an even bigger gun, am I right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006121|About your trade ban...|
INFO_IKENI7_00006119|And they took mine from me as part of their crackdown.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006115|Well, that was the plan. Now, the Clerics have stopped me trading and cut off all the supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006114|Of course I didn't let them, but getting around their ban isn't simple.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006113|And that's the main problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006112|Mostly directly from Tavar. |
INFO_IKENI7_00006111|Where do you get your goods from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006110|And, you just let them do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006109|So, if you can get them, you can sell them for a high price.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006108|And getting hold of supplies is hard out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006107|Lots of nervous people close to the Albs tend to be willing to invest shards in their safety you see?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006106|I got in before things got so paranoid. And I came here for profit of course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006105|If it's so hard to get in, what are you doing here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006103|The Clerics are a little jumpy at the moment. You might say 'paranoid'.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006102|However you got in, you're going to find it even harder to get out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006101|They obviously don't consider Berserkers a threat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006100|I didn't think they'd ever let one of us in again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006099|Preferential treatment, I bet, seeing as you're a Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006093|How did you get the guard to let you into the Dome?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006092|Ah, what have we here, fresh meat?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006091|I shall just have to hope that we manage to stop whatever trouble is being planned before it leads to casualties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006090|Rather than just turning up with bad news.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006089|If you want to fit in here you should start thinking about offering help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006087|What? Who?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006085|Someone else took delivery of the weapons shipment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006084|You have my thanks and I am sure Calaan's as well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006083|Good. Calaan's judgment is ever present.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006082|The dealer is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006081|But, thanks to your actions, I don't think any more deliveries will find their way here in the weeks to come. And that comes as a relief to us all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006080|No, no. I was just curious.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006079|You wanted him dead?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006078|Ah, yes. The weapons dealer. How is he doing? Is he still alive?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006077|Here, your reward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006076|Good, I wanted the whole shipment intact.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006075|Look for yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006074|I am glad to hear it. I hope that the goods are all there?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006073|I have what you wanted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006072|This is a place for new beginnings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006069|You may need them to buy yourself some trust.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006068|Take these shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006067|Get her talking and hope that she brings you in on her plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006066|Good. Very well then. Your target is a woman. Her name is Paige.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006065|I'll take care of that problem for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006064|Particularly when it comes to Outlaws. |
INFO_IKENI7_00006063|And missing things leads to nasty surprises. And I'd rather be the one dealing those out than receiving them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006062|Of course. Information is key to keeping the peace. But, there are always things you miss.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006061|You've been using informers to try and catch them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006060|About the Outlaws' weapons delivery...|
INFO_IKENI7_00006059|I want you to intercept this delivery and bring it to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006058|One of my people has reported that the Outlaws are expecting a weapons delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006056|And who knows who the Outlaws will sell them to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006055|The last thing that this city needs is more weapons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006053|One more issue, one wobble and everything we've held together here will fall to pieces.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006052|You must have noticed that the mood is very heated here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006051|If you want to help there is something that has to be taken care of quickly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006050|And, yes, I do have a use for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006048|You see the effect this place has on people? It brings everyone together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006047|An Outlaw of Tavar is offering me help?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006045|We all need help at times.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006043|Is there something I can help you with?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006042|Well, let's say that I'm the person trying to hold all these threads together. There's no ruler here, we all work together.|Diplomatic, modest
INFO_IKENI7_00006041|You are in charge here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006040|Some have tried. And yet I am still here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006039|This City was created by the Great Council of Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006038|I promised my life to Calaan. I will do my duty to him and for all here in this city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006037|And, what then? I should just allow our enemies to take over here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006036|Then just quit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006035|And here we are. In the middle.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006034|All told, very dark signs that we face another global catastrophe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006033|And the Alb Separatists seek shelter with us to escape the powers in Xacor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006032|The Outlaws are more organized now the Duke has taken power.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006031|But, I digress...|
INFO_IKENI7_00006030|The Berserkers have lived more and more reclusively ever since the Pilgrim went into his retreat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006029|Maybe it will help you if I tell how things are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006028|Only when we emulate him do we stand a chance of understanding what true harmony looks like.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006027|People lack perfection; that is reserved for our god.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006026|For those without faith. Those without rules, or purpose.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006025|A whole host of reasons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006024|Isn't that typical behavior for people?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006023|Why have things become so bad?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006022|There is war out there and here your shards will be stolen from your hand if you aren't careful. It's like the world has gone crazy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006021|Those tensions drive greed, anger and fear.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006017|And there's always the fear of an Alb invasion.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006016|Tensions can run high if the Outlaws attack the Clerics, or the Clerics attack the Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006015|Tense. The battles out there are always reflected in here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006014|How are things here in the Domed City?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006012|That means to accommodate everyone we're on strict rations and those rations have to be earned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006011|And providing for the people we already have is a...logistical challenge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006010|Whatever you're searching for, it will only add to the list of demands we already face.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006009|Everyone here wants something |
INFO_IKENI7_00006008|Believe me, we've had quite a few people come here and proclaim special rights for themselves, and they were all the same.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006007|And what makes you so special?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006005|It is our job to serve all, no matter their background.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006004|So, it is our job to remain neutral.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006003|The Great Council may be long gone, but what they stood for, a unity of purpose, a future for all of Magalan together. That is something we still believe in here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006002|They made the Clerics custodians of this place and their legacy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00006001|What if someone wanted to replace you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00006000|So, please excuse me if I am short with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005999|That is why I'm glad both of us are on the same page.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005998|Correct. That is what distinguishes a true Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005997|Leadership and a strong faith.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005996|You, the Berserkers and we Clerics are similar in this regard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005995|Laws, leadership, however you want to call it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005994|People need laws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005993|Your rules don't apply to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005992|Even outlaws have leaders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005991|People need freedom not leaders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005990|By Calaan, there really are more pleasant posts they could have appointed me to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005989|Maintaining a neutral position to the factions while fighting the Albs...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005988|And it hasn't been easy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005987|I have been in office for eight years now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005986|How long have you been in charge of the Domed City?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005985|This city is made up of a whole mass of confusion. Everyone looking for a new start, no one able to forget their past. They need a leader to hold things together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005984|This 'city' does not run itself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005983|I have a lot to do, as you can imagine.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005982|Yes? Is there something urgent?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005981|If these Outlaws will not help in the fight against the Albs then their supplies will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005980|I will wait for some reinforcements and then send these supplies back to the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005979|What will you do now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005978|Here, to acknowledge your contribution.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005977|Our mission has been achieved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005976|Calaan be praised! We have what we need!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005975|Let us deal with these Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005974|Good. Then let us not waste any more time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005973|You can count on me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005972|If you won't help us, you are too much of a risk. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005971|And, watch you leave here so you can go to warn the scavengers we're coming?|Non-sequiter - reacting to the refusal to help
INFO_IKENI7_00005970|You can do your own killing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005969|Since you're so curious, why don't you help me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005967|Since these scrap scavengers have become a problem, we will have to take them out of the picture.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005966|We will deal with the root cause of this problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005965|So, what are you going to do now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005964|And, you're shocked by that? What else means more to an Outlaw than a handful of shards?|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00005963|Sam was right then, you have paid the Outlaws to give you their scrap.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005962|You think the Outlaws are that organized?|Superior, arrogant
INFO_IKENI7_00005961|The Hort will put this scrap to good use, not use it to sponsor chems and debauchery like this Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005960|He's dead if he doesn't get those deliveries to me soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005959|Tell him...|Menacing
INFO_IKENI7_00005957|What should I tell Trevor?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005956|Best to keep these things simple.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005955|They're dead if they don't get those deliveries to me soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005954|Tell them...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005953|What exactly should I tell your scrap scavengers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005952|Even my legendary patience has its limits.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005951|That makes you my Plan B.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005949|That means you're going to go out and make it clear to my people that they can't walk over me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005948|The fact they stand out might make them a bit jumpy if they see a new face. So, be cautious when you approach them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005947|They're not the usual employers you'd find in Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005946|He of all people should know pain is the best disciplinarian.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005945|Things wouldn't have gone this far if Logan hadn't been so lenient on those damn Clerics.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00005944|So, those scrap collectors finally realized they needed to deliver did they?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005943|Your delivery of scrap will arrive soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005940|You can't count on anything, or anyone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005936|All hail the Duke'. Oh, and I suppose I should still pay you.|Finishing the act then back to business
INFO_IKENI7_00005935|Let us bury their failure here with these words - 'They died failing to do their job. Let the sands eat the fuckers. May their useless souls be quickly forgotten'.|Mock act of rememberance
INFO_IKENI7_00005934|Not much point threatening the dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005933|Then the matter is settled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005931|There are always people trying to take what you've got. By planning, through laziness.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005930|All your scrap scavengers in the west are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005929|Trevor is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005928|Trevor is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005927|The scrap scavenger's contact, Lucky Sam, is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005926|So, what will you do now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005925|I will not fail again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005924|We need those resources.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005923|If we can't force anyone else to get us those resources, we'll have to leave and think again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005921|We haven't gathered anywhere near the resources we need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005920|Then our mission has failed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005919|The scrap scavengers you were dealing with are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005918|Maybe, you'd have killed me right then, I had to be careful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005917|So, I owe it to them to be wary. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005916|And, it's a small margin of profit that feeds or condemns your men.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005915|You never know who else might try to earn something from your dealings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005914|Business requires keeping things confidential.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005913|Because, it would have been dumb. Information isn't just profit, it's security.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005912|You're one of Logan's people. There's no love lost between them and the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005910|You think I should have told you just because you're one of them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005909|Why didn't you tell me you're trading with Clerics?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005908|Here, take this as thanks for the warning.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005907|We can always return in force later.|Excusing his decision
INFO_IKENI7_00005906|I will follow your advice. We will withdraw from here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005905|Calaan is just.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005904|I don't have anything to tell you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005903|Step out of line and that will be an end to it. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005902|And, our mission will be carried out. So, move along and leave me be.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005901|Calaan has told us our duty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005900|Just don't give me a reason to change your luck.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005899|And, count yourself lucky you didn't get yourself shot, Outlaw. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005897|And, watch your behavior.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005896|I'm keeping watch here and I'm telling you to keep moving.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005895|For Ignadon and the followers of Calaan!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005894|Maybe we will, but your blood will be spilt first.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005893|That is much better. Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005892|I persuaded them to leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005891|They're not dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005890|If they mount a proper assault, the losses could be more than the gains made here.|Changing his mind
INFO_IKENI7_00005889|Then maybe you're right.|Thinking it over
INFO_IKENI7_00005888|Whether it's to get rid of you, or to steal what you have, they'll come.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005887|Do you think the Outlaws will mount an assault on us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005886|But...you are right, every risk must be weighed against its advantage.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005885|Duty is nothing, if you give up in troubled times.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005884|Then go die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005883|Is your duty worth more than your life? Dying here won't serve your god.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005882|I will not betray my duty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005881|I'm not leaving until I get orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005880|Not with Calaan's blessing on me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005879|You, kill me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005878|What about it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005877|About your mission here...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005876|Wrong choice, now you die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005875|You're going to tear down your base and leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005873|Now, that is unfortunate. I thought we would have a lot longer before anyone realized what we are doing.|Considering the implications
INFO_IKENI7_00005872|People at the Fort have noticed the missing scrap deliveries.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005867|It seems we will have to spend some more. In Tavar you can buy a man's soul for Elexit.|Sneering
INFO_IKENI7_00005866|The payment of a few shards is normally enough to keep anyone safe in Tavar. That and the persuasive will of a Cleric is enough to keep us safe.|Superior
INFO_IKENI7_00005865|Aren't you worried about the Duke attacking you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005864|Anything we might take now, is simply balancing the equation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005863|The Outlaws have been raiding us in secret for years.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005862|Besides, we aren't seeking war. Just redress.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005861|A good weapon, training and faith are all we need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005860|Coming into enemy territory with such a small group, that's a brave move.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005859|I will serve Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005858|Calaan expects.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005857|Calaan is just.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005856|Why would you commit such a treason? Why would you come here to tell me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005853|A Cleric acting against the will of Calaan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005852|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005851|And, from your tone, do I take it you are responsible for that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005850|You won't receive any more scrap deliveries from the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005849|You don't end up out here in the desert without a purpose.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005848|Now, tell me, what are you doing here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005847|Vigilance is duty. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005846|In Tavar you don't have to look for a fight to find one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005845|I'm not looking for a fight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005844|Who made you so jumpy?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005843|And, trust can stop you getting killed by people you creep up on in the desert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005842|Truth has value. It buys trust.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005841|Does it make any difference who I say I am?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005840|You will die for Calaan!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005839|I can't believe you dared to come here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005837|Acolyte! Help me to execute Calaan's will!|Shouting out to a guy standing next to them.
INFO_IKENI7_00005836|What is there anywhere in Tavar that could make any man proud?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005835|And, you almost sound proud of your choice to side with the rats of Tavar.|Sneering
INFO_IKENI7_00005834|An Outlaw that speaks the truth? That's rare.|Sneering
INFO_IKENI7_00005833|I'm an Outlaw.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005830|The question remains - who are you and what are you doing here?|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00005829|Great, you're a Cleric.|Spiky
INFO_IKENI7_00005828|I am a Cleric like you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005827|Not a step further. Who are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005826|I will. You can count on me. I know the difference between trusting in luck and shooting yourself in the head.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005825|Good. You'd better stick to the agreement .|
INFO_IKENI7_00005822|The delivery will be on its way to the Fort soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005821|Right, okay, if you say so. Then I'm not worried about them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005820|You don't have to worry about them anymore.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005819|What about my other trading partners?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005818|Okay, okay, I get your point. But, it's not that easy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005817|You will terminate your trade agreement with the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005816|But, between our deaths, or theirs, that wasn't a choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005815|Another man's death is never a reason to celebrate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005814|Your trade agreement with the followers of Calaan is over.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005813|You'll find my 'employers' not far from here, to the northeast.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005812|Where do I find your new employer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005811|Hey, about what you said...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005810|Do you think you can sort that out for the good of all of us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005809|Well, then we'd be able to start delivering scrap to the Fort again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005808|Now, if they were to accidentally meet their maker.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005807|They're close by, probably watching us right now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005806|Okay, there's a small group of Clerics who want my scrap, right? |Thinking.
INFO_IKENI7_00005805|Let me think, let me think...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005804|If you don't send a delivery, the Fort will send a group of Enforcers to make sure they get what they want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005803|Yeah? Why should I?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005802|Damn it. One minute you're swimming in shards the next you're standing in shit.|Referring to his own situation
INFO_IKENI7_00005801|You don't have a choice. I'd think again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005799|You can stay, but if you do it without making deliveries, you and your men will be killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005798|We had to work together, take the risk to clear this place. We deserve the reward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005797|Before my men and I came here, this place was swarming with creatures.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005796|Do you know how hard it was to get this place for myself?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005795|Then get out of here. If you don't you are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005793|Yeah? And? Fuck the Fort. The guys there can kiss my ass.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005792|People in the Fort are expecting your scrap deliveries to start again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005791|You'll be a dead idiot if you don't. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005790|I would have to be a complete idiot to agree to that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005789|What, are you crazy? He will never pay me what I am earning now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005788|Change of plan. You're going to start making deliveries to the Scrap Baron again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005787|The new guy we're supplying, he's going to guarantee we earn what we need to. Thank you, you've saved lives.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005786|I was able to get more shards than I thought was possible.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005785|I was just thinking that. Thanks to you, I made the deal of my life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005784|You again. What a lucky coincidence.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005783|I'm satisfied, you're paid. Everything is as it should be.|Cool, pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00005782|And, I know you're not crazy enough to turn it down.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005781|And, fuck company, business is not about personality, it's about profit!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005780|Aw, I could take that personally. What's wrong with my company?|Mocking
INFO_IKENI7_00005779|Just pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005778|They might say I'm 'mad', but I know profit.|Annoyed at the term
INFO_IKENI7_00005777|Take these shards, trade, have fun, buy some grenades to juggle, whatever floats your doodah and then come back here for more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005776|Disappointing.|With a tut
INFO_IKENI7_00005775|You'd turn down payment to save the head of some someone you don't know?|Surprised
INFO_IKENI7_00005774|Forget what I said. Just give me what I am owed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005773|I like that, really. Profit is predictable. It means I know we can work together any time. Never trust anyone who doesn't understand that Elexit comes first.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005772|Profit above everything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005771|There. Someone who gets what this is about.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005770|Shoot whoever you want, as long as you pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005769|How does that sound?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005768|If I made room on my payroll by, say helping one of my less helpful personnel disappear you could get paid double. I can make that happen.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00005767|If it buys that and loyalty, I'll pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005766|I solved your problem. It's worth that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005765|Double?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005764|Pay me double.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005763|And, remember most people come to me begging for work and profit.|Friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00005761|If I want you to work for me, you'll work for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005760|You haven't learned the rules of the desert yet, have you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005759|Then we're done. I'm not working for you again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005758|Despite their failure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005757|Right. Sounds like I'd better do something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005756|He'll have to get the job done with what he has.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005755|Everyone always wants more. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005754|Loyal, I always said, Trevor is loyal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005753|He'll definitely have more problems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005752|So, you think he'll have more problems?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005751|But, he's normally loyal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005750|He doesn't need reinforcements. He's just complaining.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005749|He needs some reinforcements.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005748|Sometimes, needs to be told he'll lose his head if he's not.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005746|Trevor was cooperative.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005745|If he can just calm down, I can get him the rest. He knows I'm good for it, he knows I can get the stuff, he'll get his profit.|Fast talking protest
INFO_IKENI7_00005744|Take this, make him understand the situation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005743|That will have to be enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005742|I'll send him what I have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005741|He'll be your biggest problem if you stall him any longer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005740|You missed the Scrap Baron off your list.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005739|Albs, rats, reavers... The path to the Fort is full of dangers!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005738|You can't be serious? How am I supposed to manage that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005737|Okay, okay... I got it. He wants his stuff? He will get it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005736|Time you don't have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005735|Hey, I will deliver, but it will take me time...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005734|If you want him to send his Enforcers after you...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005733|You'll make the delivery in the next few hours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005731|Thanks to you, it is finally possible for me to start making deliveries again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005730|I just need a few more days. Tell him that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005729|I am going as fast as I can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005728|The Scrap Baron is becoming impatient.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005727|You know how to make deals.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005726|So, are you with us, or not?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005724|But, you don't have to worry, I'll get us a good deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005722|I'm not revealing my business connections.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005721|Who is the buyer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005720|Just piss off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005719|I...I have to leave!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005718|I had better get out of here. If the Scrap Baron learns he won't get his deliveries...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005717|Oh shittttt! Do you know what that means for me?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005716|Sam is dead?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005715|There will be no more deliveries. Sam is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005714|So, did you get that trash weasel to work for me again?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005713|You think the Scrap Baron showers me in shards? You think he wants those trash pickers to be rolling in Elexit?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005712|You see how they get treated in the Fort? I treat them like kings, kings!|Protesting
INFO_IKENI7_00005711|Right, right, the pay was crap, the food was worse, but he's a damn scavenger.|Protesting
INFO_IKENI7_00005710|What are you talking about?|Protesting
INFO_IKENI7_00005709|As far as I can see, he had more than one reason to stop working.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005707|You seem useful. That's rare out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005706|Scrap scavengers. They're nothing but rats.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005705|Yeah, the Fort sent a gang to work with me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005701|Just don't mess with my profits.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005700|Now, you think you know me? |
INFO_IKENI7_00005698|Seeing as you're here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005696|That depends.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005695|I am a people magnet.|Modest - convinced of his own charisma.
INFO_IKENI7_00005694|It wasn't the scrap, it was your magnetic personality.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005693|I hereby challenge you to state who you are and what you want.|Well-practised speech
INFO_IKENI7_00005688|Well, you're not getting in without giving me a damn good reason to let you in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005687|Oh, you want in do you? And, you think I'm standing out here to give cakes and hugs to everyone who arrives? Is it? Is that what you think?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005686|Just let me into the town.|Aggressive
INFO_IKENI7_00005683|But, I've heard some of them are painting themselves to look normal just so they can come in here and cause trouble.|Considering, suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00005682|Do I look like an Alb?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005681|Good, then I welcome you in the name of the Berserkers.|Overdoing it.
INFO_IKENI7_00005680|Understood.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005679|All right, all right, you can go in, but all weapons must remain sheathed. Start anything and a Paladin'll turn you to ash faster than you can say 'I wish that Duras guy hadn't sent me here'.|All options lead to this one
INFO_IKENI7_00005678|You'd better think about reporting to Ragnar, or one of the other Warlords when you get in then.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005676|Oh, you're one of Duras's hand-me-downs, are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005675|Duras sent me here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005673|In the name of the Hooded Crows and with the power invested in me by the Warlords of Goliet...|Self-important
INFO_IKENI7_00005669|If you do want it then get it done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005668|Do you want this job, or not? If not - fuck off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005666|Can't one of your people get you your scrap?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005665|That is what I wanted to hear.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005664|Yes. I'll get those scrap deliveries to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005663|Is that clear?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005662|So, I want you to head west, find the scrap scavengers there and make it clear that I want those deliveries.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005661|Normally, the deliveries are up to Trevor, but I haven't heard anything from him for some time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005660|Remind him who he's dealing with. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005659|Fucker shouldn't need to be reminded, but it seems he needs it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005658|But, he's stalling me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005657|Talk to Trevor, he's supposed to be in command over there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005656|They're holding out on some deliveries they owe me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005655|Get yourself over to the scrap digs in the west.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005651|What do you want?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005650|Just don't fuck it up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005649|You can make yourself useful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005645|I know they're easier to get with help. And, I'll bet you don't care where that help comes from.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005642|What the fuck do you know about profits?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005640|A true Outlaw, hey?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005639|Then you do belong here in Tavar.|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00005638|Scrap is profit, I'm here for shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005637|Does it matter why I came?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005636|Deep down you're a scrap hound aren't you? You just can't resist the lure of salvage.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005635|Here again? |
INFO_IKENI7_00005634|It's all that I can spare. I am sorry if you were hoping for more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005633|That's it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005632|Thanks for your help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005631|I'm here for Sam.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005630|What is that supposed to mean?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005629|Come on then.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005628|People like you only understand one language don't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005627|They owe me! They owe me a scrap delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005626|You think I owe Sam and his men?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005625|Maybe, they didn't deliver the scrap because you didn't pay them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005624|Do you want to trade?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005623|And, I am the best scrap dealer you'll find in Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005622|They call me Lucky Sam.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005620|I'm always looking for scrap and you need shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005619|And, if you're looking for salvage, I'll take your shards for it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005618|If you find something of interest, sell it to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005617|But, I will make you an offer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005615|The higher the concentration, the more I'll pay you for it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005614|Anything with a good concentration of Elex in it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005613|Loyalty is shards, but I've got business I have to take care of.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005612|No, that's not going to happen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005611|I could use someone like you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005610|What will earn me the most shards?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005609|Scavenging?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005608|I'm out here to get rich.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005607|I'm not here to pick up a few tin cans.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005602|Is that how you live out here? By scavenging?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005601|Speaking isn't going to change Trevor's mind. But, sure go ahead and try. Just remember I'm here to make a deal when you decide you can be more forceful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005600|Do that. Information is profit!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005599|Right, I'll remember that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005598|Being observant, that will help you be lucky! Stay safe out there, my friend.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005597|You shouldn't believe his threats, he won't follow through.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005596|Ah, so you've already figured that one out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005595|Yeah, I'd realized that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005594|He always pretends to be bigshot, but that's a cover story.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005593|A ruthless bunch that you'd better watch your step around, with the exception of William.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005592|As you might know, the Duke governs the Fort with his family. You know, William, Nasty and their cohort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005591|And, since you've helped me out. I'll help you, that's how luck works best.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005590|This business is my life, so, here take this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005589|Okay, okay, I do have a few more shards.|Grumbling
INFO_IKENI7_00005588|That will cover it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005587|You're stretching your luck if you think that is going to be enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005586|I have had enough of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005585|Then don't stand around and get moving!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005584|Not yet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005582|The opposite. I now work for him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005581|Ah, I don't even want to know. Let him grin as much as he wants, the main thing is you got him to work for me again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005580|So. Does he still have that stupid grin on his face?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005579|I met with Sam.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005578|The Scrap Baron blames me and my time is running short.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005577|They don't care if I'm dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005574|To kill you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005573|That's my business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005572|He didn't get any scrap from me and he's not stupid enough to have returned to the Fort empty-handed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005571|That's the last I heard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005570|You can find him south of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005569|Where can I find him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005568|It's him, or us. Take him out, or don't, you'll be killing someone either way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005567|You've seen it out here, the difference between life and death is small. If we're forced to work for Trevor it will be us dying.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005566|Killing him can't be the only way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005565|I promise. You won't be disappointed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005564|This had better pay well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005563|No one will miss him, you don't have to worry about that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005562|Only, don't expect him to pay much for the information.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005561|Tell him he can count on the delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005560|Nothing to do with you, hey?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005559|Speak to Trevor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005558|I just hope he pays out more shards from now on. Otherwise, you might start finding our bodies out here.|Downbeat
INFO_IKENI7_00005557|We'll start making deliveries to Trevor again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005556|You win, okay, you win.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005555|Okay, okay, stop, stop. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005554|You'd better hope your luck's improved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005553|You really want to do this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005552|Let's settle this. Draw your weapon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005551|Hah, I guess you didn't get lucky with that run. Now, we'll sort this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005550|Then you'd better hope that luck is on your side!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005549|No joke, straight choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005548|Is that supposed to be a joke?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005547|You'll make the deal, or I'll make you pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005546|You want me to...all right, all right, maybe I have delayed the deal too long.|Nervous, but persuaded.
INFO_IKENI7_00005545|You'll work for Trevor again. Clear?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005544|But, for this much I'd look for scrap in Xacor!|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00005543|Shards talk, you really put something together there.|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00005542|Take these shards, that should make it worth delivering to Trevor again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005541|About Trevor's scrap delivery...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005540|Either, we get more shards, or that deal is through. Trevor won't get anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005539|Look, I know I play it tough, you have to out here. But, these guys rely on me. I'm trying to look after them.|Appealing to the player.
INFO_IKENI7_00005538|You can't make me deal with him. And, you should look at it from my perspective before you try.|Appealing to the player.
INFO_IKENI7_00005537|First I want to hear his version of the story.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005535|Here, take this. It's more than you would have got from that miserly son of a bitch.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005534|And, that's why they call me 'Lucky'! I knew meeting you was going to turn out well.|Pleaed
INFO_IKENI7_00005532|Your business with Trevor is done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005531|It's already taken care of. Trevor is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005530|All he cares about is the delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005529|If he paid properly, he'd get the business. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005528|He thinks his connections mean he can take our scrap for nothing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005527|One of the Scrap Baron's asskickers - Trevor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005526|Who are you having problems with?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005525|But, there are always issues with old connections, people who seem to think they are owed something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005523|That's the only way that this gets sorted out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005522|We want out of this and that means killing him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005521|Trevor knows that, he doesn't care.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005520|We've got to make a living out here and with what Trevor tries to pay us...well, that's not really giving us an opportunity to do that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005519|I'll tell Trevor he has to pay you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005518|Your agreement, your mess and that means you're stuck with it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005517|If you can get us out of this. I'll make it worth your while.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005515|Would you take care of cutting all connections to our old employer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005514|Maybe, you can help us after all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005513|Unless anyone else comes with a better deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005512|The Scrap Baron, who else?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005510|So, who buys this stuff?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005509|Then he might get his business back again.|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00005508|The bastard owes us food supplies and he needs to show an interest in paying us properly.|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00005507|Trevor? You've met that miser have you?|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00005506|So, if you're looking for profit, why've you stopped supplying Trevor?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005505|All those costs, it means I rely on the bonuses to get by.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005504|Then there's all the 'extra' expenses you need to keep your scrap collectors happy, they like the Entertainment District you see?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005503|Some sites yield nothing, and the good ones are getting harder to find.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005502|Don't let your eyes shine so fast, it's not an easy business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005501|You've got rich with scrap?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005500|Just don't go stressing me. All right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005499|You have a point.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005498|You think I'd come to you and ask questions if I was a bounty hunter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005497|Why should I believe you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005496|Good, right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005495|I am calm.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005494|Yeah. But, all right, I don't see why you'd deny it. So let's both just calm it down, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005493|Do I look like a bounty hunter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005491|I am not a scrap collector, understand?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005490|Do you never wonder what our world could have been if...whatever happened hadn't happened.?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005489|I mean, do you never ask yourself that? I mean, if you just look at all this stuff, their world was full of this technology.|Trying to make sense of it
INFO_IKENI7_00005488|But, I don't know anything about the people who made them, Who they were, or what happened to them.|Enthused
INFO_IKENI7_00005487|I spend every day picking this stuff up and we just sell it, break it up for components, melt it down.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005486|Why do you want to know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005485|He'd know. I'd be dead. Forget it.|Spelling out a refusal
INFO_IKENI7_00005484|Sure. You think the Scrap Baron got where he is without sniffing BS like that at a mile?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005482|Then what do you want?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005481|What the Scrap Baron doesn't see, the Scrap Baron doesn't know.|Persuasive
INFO_IKENI7_00005480|I am not here to trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005479|Yes. I accept those terms.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005478|That is correct. What is your answer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005477|To get your pledge, I will owe you a favor?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005476|You know my mind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005475|Take that time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005474|I need more time to think.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005473|It is best we forget the situation with Hakon quickly. It was unhelpful for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005472|If you're not here - you must be a bounty hunter!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005471|Wait a moment, if you're not here to help us...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005470|So, get out there and get collecting scrap. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005469|Of course you're here to work. Because, that means you'll get paid and as a bonus our powerful benefactor won't decide to, you know, kill you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005465|You're confused. I am not a scrap collector.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005464|I'm not here to work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005463|Come on, let's get moving!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005462|Look for pieces with a high concentration of Elex, those are what the buyer will want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005461|Grab your cock and get ready to rock, because we've got some great scrap out there just waiting to be dug up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005460|So, has word spread that there's Elexit to be earned here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005459|I've added a bit more to show I'm not holding anything back, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005458|Here, take this. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005457|Right, right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005456|And, I will be happy with you if you pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005455|No, the fact it works is enough. The Scrap Baron will be pleased he's getting his scrap. Which means he'll be pleased with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005454|You want the details?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005453|I guess you're really persuasive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005452|Your men will work for you again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005451|All right, but don't go crazy. They're not going to help me if they're dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005450|Either, they'll do it willingly, or I will force them back to work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005448|All right, let's hear how you think you can do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005447|I will get your men to start working.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005446|I am just lacking in ideas. If you think of one let me know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005445|I guess I don't have much choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005444|Yeah, I'd like to avoid that too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005443|Hey, are you the judge here now? Just help me, ok?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005442|Huh...and you wonder why they are turning against you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005440|Good job I didn't pay those assholes what I'd promised. Now, I've got the shards to pay you instead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005439|You're in for profit? That makes sense.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005438|And, without that scrap...I'm dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005437|Because, I don't want to see you turned into dog food.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005436|Because, you are going to pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005435|Why do you want to help me at all?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005434|Last time I trusted someone, they ran off on me and landed me in this situation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005433|And, I'm supposed to trust you just like that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005432|I can help you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005431|But, now it's too late. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005430|So, you've given up?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005429|And, I'm not going looking for them on my own. If the Scrap Baron is pissed he'll have to come and find me here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005428|It shouldn't be my problem, if the Scrap Baron wants the scrap he should be helping me stop those guys. He's the one with the reputation!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005424|Begging wouldn't get me anywhere and there are too many to threaten.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005423|Let's finish this, you parasite!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005420|First you offer to help me then you do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005419|Wrong. Your time just ran out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005417|They're only interested in the scrap they got.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005416|They said they won't work for me anymore.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005414|The last time I requested my goods, they spat in my face.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005413|And, that means?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005412|We had a deal, but they had guns. I am just glad they didn't plug me before they went.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005411|But, they stole the scrap instead of delivering it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005410|If scrap's so important why are you here on your own?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005409|Why did you let them get away with it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005408|Now, there's just sand. Ruins. Outlaws. If only there was a way to bring all that stuff back.|Fascinated
INFO_IKENI7_00005407|Where we're standing, there were millions of people around here. Millions.|Fascinated
INFO_IKENI7_00005406|This used to be a country, until the Comet hit and then 'pow!' destroyed. All those people, all those buildings wiped out.|Fascinated
INFO_IKENI7_00005405|Me? I'm from here. The desert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005404|Why don't you tell me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005403|Here we are spending our days stealing from ghosts and hoping no one kills us for doing it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005402|You're not an Alb are you? Shit, no, you can't be.|Suddenly wary
INFO_IKENI7_00005401|Even the Outlaws have history.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005400|What are you, an Alb?|Not knowing this
INFO_IKENI7_00005399|Where I come from we don't have stories.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005398|Tell me them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005397|I mean there must have been stories, people must have tales they tell about where they live?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005396|Well, maybe you can tell me about the history of where you're from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005395|What's that to do with you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005394|Where are you from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005393|Yeah, yeah I suppose it is.|Sad
INFO_IKENI7_00005392|The past is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005391|No, why should I care?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005390|I mean we live amongst the ruins of the Old World, but what do we really know about it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005389|What happened here? Have you never asked yourself that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005388|The desert, Tavar, hey, all of Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005387|I want to know what you know about, you know...this place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005386|What do you want to know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005385|I suppose you don't like helpful answers either?|Hinting that they can help each other.
INFO_IKENI7_00005384|You don't like questions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005383|Okay. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005382|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005381|Can I ask a question while we're talking?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005380|...he gives them to the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005378|If the Scrap Baron tears your balls off...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005377|Everyone reports to the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005376|But, the Scrap Baron reports to the Duke?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005375|And, he does pay. We all get our share of the profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005374|You don't mess with the Duke, or the Scrap Baron. Not if you want to keep all of your body parts attached to the rest of your body.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005373|Loyalty? This is Tavar. Nobody is loyal to anything but shards here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005372|So, it's fear not loyalty?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005370|And, the Scrap Baron is one of the Duke's main guys up at the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005369|You don't get made lord of all salvage by the Duke, by talking nicely to people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005368|I don't know. Maybe, because he's cold-blooded, profit-obsessed nut job.|Pointing out the obvious
INFO_IKENI7_00005367|Why are you so scared of the Scrap Baron?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005366|His answer to goods going missing is to rip whoever takes it a new one. And, I don't want any new holes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005365|Everything here belongs to the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005362|I don't trust strangers. I don't trust people who haven't committed to a faction. That means I don't trust you.|Hostile
INFO_IKENI7_00005361|That means everything I find here goes straight to the Scrap Baron.|Reinforcing the point
INFO_IKENI7_00005360|Don't think you can turn up here and take ours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005359|What are you even doing here? Are you out of resources in Ignadon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005358|Are you upset because there aren't enough plants to talk to?|Mocking
INFO_IKENI7_00005356|Yeah, and?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005355|Pretty isolated here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005354|Dumbasses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005353|He'll wait until that Elex is ready then we'll use our explosives to blast their asses back to Xacor.|Enthused
INFO_IKENI7_00005352|That's got to be what the Duke is thinking, why else would he let them stay there?|This is an assumption.
INFO_IKENI7_00005351|We liberate our minds.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005350|Screw them, assholes were dumb enough to get caught.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005349|And, the people that end up in the Converter don't bother you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005348|So, they're doing the work for us. They set the machine up, we take the Elex. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005347|Those Albs stuff their Converter with everything that contains Elex, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005346|I'd be happy if they all died tomorrow. But, no, you're not getting it, you see?.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005345|No, no, fuck that. And, fuck the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005344|What? Screw that! I told you chems set you free, they don't turn you into one of those robots!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005343|They stay away from the Converter and the Elex!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005342|Afraid? Fuck, I'm shit scared of them. I'm not an idiot, I don't want to die. And yeah, other people feel that way too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005341|You take Elex? You sound like an Alb.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005340|You're not afraid of the Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005339|And, that Alb Converter is going to help us all find freedom - whooo.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005338|Freeing - your - mind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005337|That Doc, he knows what Elex should really be used for. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005336|You can jack it and not worry about turning into an Alb.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005335|The Doc's the best chemsmith here. He mixes Elex into all sorts of things.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005334|Elex? Only if you want a fuel for your next trip.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005333|Can you buy Elex here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005332|Then there's his cousin William. Plays the big man.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005331|Oh, and don't try talking to her unless you have something real to say. She can't stand small talk, or people who don't get to the point, the point being shards, or fighting.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005330|And there's his favorites - Chloe, Blake, Big Jim and Mad Bob. Just, don't go calling Bob 'Mad Bob' to his face. When you're talking to him, he's the Scrap Baron.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005329|She looks after planning and things, but she's restless.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005328|Well, there's his twin sister 'Nasty', she can handle herself, but I get the sense she's bored in here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005327|Tell me about his people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005326|But, things aren't too bad under the Duke's leadership I suppose, Life can be good if you don't cross him, or his people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005325|So, Baxter got out. Fuck knows where he is now, probably dead under a rock.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005324|And, that sister of his, Nasty, she had the brains. Found the weak spots in the defenses and brought the Duke's men right in here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005323|The Duke happened. The Duke and his family. The Duke had the muscle, the connections, the firepower.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005322|So, what happened to Baxter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005321|Yeah, yeah, right. Hope it's helpful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005320|I've heard enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005319|But, with a vision, a dream and just a touch of sadistic, overly brutal asskicking, Baxter turned a pisspot into a gold mine.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005318|Before that they were just a bunch of ruins, full of scrap, a place to piss in out of the desert sun.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005317|Baxter turned the Fort into what it is today.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005316|Do you know about Baxter? Bloody Baxter? He used to be in charge here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005315|Right, er, okay. So, where do I begin?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005314|What do you think I should know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005313|Like what? What do you want to know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005312|Tell me about this place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005310|Have you returned as an emissary of peace? I can see you haven't.|Asking then taking a beat to assess the player
INFO_IKENI7_00005308|You were warned what would happen if you returned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005307|You'll stay away from here if you value your life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005306|Now, go. Before I decide to send a different message and return you to the Fort in pieces.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005305|I can promise you that peace will prove more profitable than war for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005304|Tell the Outlaws that they can fight us, or leave the forces of Calaan to their mission|
INFO_IKENI7_00005303|And that sentence will be carried out immediately.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005302|But, the penalty for traitors is death.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005301|If you were anyone else, I'd have you detained.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005299|Then, perhaps, we should use you to send him a message.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005298|And, if I don't?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005296|So, the Duke isn't interested in conversation, only conflict?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005295|Then by order of the Outlaws, you'll die here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005294|That wasn't a request, Cleric. You leave now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005293|I'll leave when my mission is complete.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005291|I only take orders from Ignadon.|Calm
INFO_IKENI7_00005290|Leave Tavar. Now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005287|But...if you feel you need an equalizer, take this.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005283|Hah, you over estimate them. They aren't really a challenge without their fighting machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005282|It will be difficult to kill the Clerics without the proper equipment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005280|Under no circumstances do I want to know what your motives are, or what you're doing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005279|I'll transmit the coordinates to your adjutor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005278|Okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005277|Just, just don't tell me what you're going to do with this information, it is better if you keep it to yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005276|Okay. Let's do this and do it quickly. I can guess where they are located.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005273|I want to find his old unit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005272|Why are you asking me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005271|I don't recognize him from Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005270|No. Or, maybe I just forgot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005269|Do you know the captive Cleric, Frank?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005268|Don't think I'll give you their coordinates, or tell you anything else about my brothers in Calaan. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005267|Here are, the coordinates of where they were last. Perhaps, they're still there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005266|Make the payment, but be careful. These Outlaws believe in little, but profit. And yet, here I am, their captive.|Dismissing the Outlaws, then admitting his situation
INFO_IKENI7_00005265|I wasn't sent.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005264|What does that matter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005263|Just make sure those Clerics end up dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005262|I don't care how you do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005261|Good. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005259|Yeah? |
INFO_IKENI7_00005258|The Clerics are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005257|But, I'll take your word that you did it. Because, lying to me would make you a suicidal fuckwit. Here. Your reward.|With a laugh
INFO_IKENI7_00005256|You have a lot to learn about killing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005255|I didn't bring you any ears.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005254|Trophy?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005253|I always cut off the ear of my enemies as a souvenir.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005252|Then show me the trophy you took.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005249|I didn't just hear, I saw. They're dead.|May, or may not be true
INFO_IKENI7_00005248|Let's start with the rest of the unit that came here with our ex-prisoner .|
INFO_IKENI7_00005247|All right, I'll do it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005246|And, the Duke's name will ring out across the desert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005245|Where did you hear that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005244|The Clerics are already dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005243|So, fuck off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005242|Then I don't have anything else to tell you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005241|Then we share something in common. Is that something you're prepared to do? To kill her? You could help two people at the same time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005240|Yes. You both want Iron Madison dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005239|And? Did you learn anything useful?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005238|I talked to Cindy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005236|This is the job.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005235|Oh, this is between you and me. And, you're going to keep it that way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005234|Come on, we have to do this. You'll like it. I know you'll like it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005233|A lot? Hah. Once we've killed a couple of them then the rest of them will run back to Calaan.|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00005231|You're asking a lot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005230|I'm not interested.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005229|The Duke won't agree to that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005228|That's the job you are going to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005227|Because, you're the one who is going to set the example that shows the Duke's reputation is deserved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005226|Then we're going to leave their bodies on the border to send a message to everyone there and all across Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005225|You're going to help me find them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005223|We're going to force the Clerics out of the desert. They've sent a little group of soldier boys out to invade our land.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005222|How are you going to set an example?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005221|Why should I care about the Duke's name?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005220|By the grace of Calaan, I am free. I can go, I can really get out of here? Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005219|See my generosity and think what that should mean for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005215|She'll see you as weak.|Almost a curse
INFO_IKENI7_00005214|I would've helped you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005213|You think she'll care that you helped her?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005212|You backed the wrong side.|Horrified appeal
INFO_IKENI7_00005211|Did I need a reason?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005210|It paid better.|plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00005209|What? You told her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005207|Iron Madison knows you want her dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005206|I know. And you'll be saving Liam's life. You'll be helping the whole Fort.|Enthusing
INFO_IKENI7_00005205|I'm not 'nobody'.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005204|What's the catch? Nobody does anything for free round here.|Growing suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00005203|You'll help me just like that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005202|I'll help you. You don't need to pay me.|humane minus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00005201|Oh, this Fort is full of sweet little playthings.|With relish.
INFO_IKENI7_00005200|Discipline, shards and death, there's no one who doesn't understand those languages.|Cocksure
INFO_IKENI7_00005199|Iron Madison doesn't exactly hold back on the beatings. If she learns anything about Cindy we'll both be dead!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005198|I can't keep secrets, so if you tell me then my wife will find out!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005197|I can't know what she's thinking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005196|Don't tell me. No, no, no. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005195|I talked to Cindy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005194|Don't let anyone tell you the world can't change. It can, oh, it can.|Relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00005193|I can't talk to you, I don't have permission.|Scared of his wife.
INFO_IKENI7_00005192|I know I said they were for the Duke, but...you saved my life, serious. So, here, please, take these shards back. And, thank you.|Apologising, desperate
INFO_IKENI7_00005191|So, I've got to get those shards if I want to keep walking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005190|Not that it matters, Madison will beat the shit out of me if she finds I've seen a prostitute. She'll kill me if she finds out I'm in love with Cindy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005189|Men's things? Yeah, I know, that made it worse, but it's not like that, honestly. I love Cindy. And, I can't see get to see her without paying her. |He spent the money on Cindy, with whom he is having a secret affair
INFO_IKENI7_00005188|I...well, you know...|Awkward
INFO_IKENI7_00005187|Madison owns me and I mean 'owns'. In Cindy I've...I've found someone. She's all that matters. I know what you're thinking, but this is love. True, full, undeniable love.|Upset = what comes around goes around.
INFO_IKENI7_00005186|Really? Is that what you think?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005185|It sounds like you've got what you deserve.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005184|What did you spend the shards on?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005183|This talk is undermining his reputation. And the only way to stop this talking is to set an example.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005182|That he let that Cleric live.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005181|They're saying he hesitated over the Converter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005180|But, now some people are talking behind his back, undermining that name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005178|He's earned his name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005177|I told you, you would come back.|With a sneer
INFO_IKENI7_00005176|Then we can talk.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005175|But, make sure you get that Cleric out of the Fort first.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005174|What's this job you want doing?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005173|Hartmut, is a true follower of Calaan. He is certain to pay you back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005172|If he's still alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005171|Iron Madison is out of the way, for now. You should get out of here whilst you can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005170|She's bitter enough to make that good, even if someone else has said I can leave. No, I can't risk leaving until she's convinced I can, or she's dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005169|When I last saw that guard, Iron Madison, she appeared convinced that the only way I'd leave was dead. Regardless of what the Duke says.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005168|Iron Madison has been handled. Nothing will happen to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005167|I'll tell you the details later.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005166|You owe me for that disrespect.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005165|Look for me when that Cleric's gone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005163|I have a job for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005161|Good. |With a snarl
INFO_IKENI7_00005160|I can do that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005159|Without talking to me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005156|I already have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005155|This world will grow again, across all the lands.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005154|You don't need Elex weapons to survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005152|And, now we have the World Hearts, the other lands should be welcoming us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005151|They should be begging us to come and heal the world instead of attacking us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005150|Generations of Berserkers have worked hard to make this place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005149|It's only here that the world is growing again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005148|I've never left Edan, but from what I've been told, the Comet scorched the ground and what didn't die was poisoned by Elex.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005147|Well, there you have me beaten.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005146|Edan is different to the other places I've been.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005144|And, if anyone says anything about Cindy and us being in love, I'll deny it.|Scared of his wife.
INFO_IKENI7_00005142|You could even say I worship her...|Scared of his wife.
INFO_IKENI7_00005141|You can tell her that if you meet her, that you've never met anyone who loves his wife as much as Liam.|Scared of his wife.
INFO_IKENI7_00005140|Still, seeing as you aren't a natural hunter, maybe you'd like to buy some goods from me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005138|It's hard enough bringing in the food I have to without some big footed oaf crashing through the forest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005137|You'd better learn quick if you want to stay alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005136|That's as plain as a horny troll in your sleeping sack.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005135|These are my hunting grounds.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005134|You crash around like that you'll scare off anything you can eat and attract everything that wants to make a meal of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005133|Technology is far from forbidden there, in fact it is seen as Magalan's best hope.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005132|And your decision to give the plasma weapons to Jora, well, that makes me think you don't share that belief.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005131|I'm not sure that life in Ignadon would suit you.|Subtle, this is still a possible recruit, but he's acted against Bertram
INFO_IKENI7_00005130|Well, since you disagreed with me about the Clerics' weapons. I'd expect you'd refuse an offer of food too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005129|But?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005128|I could offer you some food, as a gift...|Making it sound like there will be a condition to it.
INFO_IKENI7_00005127|Besides, there are things to learn here. The more people I can convince while I am here, the better it is for everyone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005124|I was the only one to survive the attack. I ran like there was no tomorrow and left my weapon behind. I'm glad they found me and brought me to Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005123|I was traveling in Edan with a comrade to scout for men and material.We found ourselves cornered by some mutants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005122|Particularly if you don't have an energy weapon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005121|Ok, ok. You seem to have figured it out. Well, it's safer here behind these walls than out there with the mutants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005120|You're staying here although you don't like it. There's something wrong about you. Tell me the truth.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005119|You see, we leave the Albs and Clerics to rely on machines. In Edan, we use magic!|Others includes Duras.
INFO_IKENI7_00005117|Just don't go flashing those weapons around when we get back, okay? Some Berserkers are really strict about the Laws. Others...are more lenient.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005115|Officially, you're supposed to hand it in when you arrive in Goliet, but, that will be your choice. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005114|Elex technology. It is forbidden to Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005113|Here, I found these.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005112|So, what do you think? Shall we risk entering the ruins?|Duras wants the player to choose to go into the ruins
INFO_IKENI7_00005111|Chances are he's just busy tending to it.|Conversational report
INFO_IKENI7_00005110|If that's the case then their weapons will still be there, in the ruins to the northwest. You can recognize them by the river that bisects them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005109|Reach them and bring the weapons back to Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005108|Sadly, that means I am certain they were killed there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005107|None of the Clerics came out again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005106|The patrol reported that a some animals chased the Clerics into a set of ruins.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005105|Where should I look for these weapons?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005103|You'll find him at the Pit. He and the workers there make sure such technology is made safe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005102|But, the weapons they left behind are lying about out there are a problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005101|We all need to be rooted in the natural world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005100|Always better to be part of a team.|

INFO_IKENI7_00005096|But, thank you! I am now free!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005095|I don't know what your part in this was...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005093|If you're lying she'll kill me for even thinking it. Oh, let it be true.|

INFO_IKENI7_00005089|Madison is dead. That is all that matters, Liam, that means we get to decide about us!|
INFO_IKENI7_00005088|You know I can't leave her, but that isn't important. Not for us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005087|We can? Does that mean you're not working for Chloe anymore?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005086|We can be together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005085|I'm free?|Hardly daring to believe
INFO_IKENI7_00005084|Yes, yes. You're free.|

INFO_IKENI7_00005068|Yes. Oh, yes. Completely, totally. What is there not to love?|Scared of his wife.
INFO_IKENI7_00005067|You really love your wife then?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005066|And, I can finally be with Cindy. |
INFO_IKENI7_00005065|I'm free.|Coming to terms with the reality.

INFO_IKENI7_00005063|I spent all my wife's shards, she found out and if I don't earn them back, she'll be wearing my balls for earrings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005062|Okay...okay...I'll admit it.|Deflating

INFO_IKENI7_00005058|No one's going to help you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005057|No, no, you don't want to fight me! Deny the Duke and it won't just be me you're fighting. You'll be fighting everyone here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005056|You're not taking shards from me without a fight.|Determined
INFO_IKENI7_00005055|And, no one here is going to let that happen.|

INFO_IKENI7_00005039|Pay up. Give me all the Elexit you have on you before I break your pretty, slutty, little neck. Come on now, or do you need me to count to three?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005038|Well, am I?|

INFO_IKENI7_00005033|Oh, here she is, the fun-time girl who believes in leaving it all behind to settle down with my slave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005032|Or, if I'll kill him for doing something stupid like trying to escape. He and Liam, they know me well.|

INFO_IKENI7_00005029|You should ask the Duke.|Sarcastic
INFO_IKENI7_00005028|Have you thought of setting that to music?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005027|Don't fuck with the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005026|Bow to the Duke, hear the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005024|More than you could ever afford. I could own you as I own little Liam. I have a lot of property in this Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005023|If you had Elexit you wouldn't be asking questions, you'd be telling people what you're worth.|Confrontational
INFO_IKENI7_00005022|How much are you worth?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005021|Is this a come on, or are you trying to work out how much Elexit I've got?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005019|If you're not worth something, you're not worth anything here. So, tell me, do you want to own, or be owned? Little Liam here is almost burned out, he needs replacing...|
INFO_IKENI7_00005018|Don't mess with the Duke? I get it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005016|That's our Outlaw version of the Berserkers' laws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005015|Don't fuck with the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005014|He has to get away from her. He has to get free.|Appealing, almost begging
INFO_IKENI7_00005013|Okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005012|Because, I care.|Appealing, emotion, she loves Liam
INFO_IKENI7_00005011|Why do you care?|
INFO_IKENI7_00005010|You know what? I can. So, I will. Wow, this new freedom is going to take some getting used to.|

INFO_IKENI7_00005008|You're coming with me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005007|I will return soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005005|The Outlaws in the convoy might have disguised themselves as Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005004|And keep your eyes open.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005003|Oh, by the sands of Tavar you don't know how glad I am to hear that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005002|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00005001|You're serious? She's really dead?|Realising
INFO_IKENI7_00005000|Do you want me to bring her body as proof?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004999|Even the Duke, our glorious leader, King of the Desert, would think twice before fighting her.|Nervous.
INFO_IKENI7_00004998|No, no chance, who'd be able to do kill her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004997|Your wife is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004996|Listen, maybe, you can ask me about it later. Now, is not the right time, okay?|Quiet, nervous
INFO_IKENI7_00004995|My wife is a wonderful lady, calm, majestic. She'd be a queen of the desert if there wasn't already a king! The Duke, our glorious leader, King of the Desert and lord of the Outlaws.|Overpraising due to terror
INFO_IKENI7_00004994|She wouldn't want to. No, no, she's a lady of integrity, I would never say anything bad about her. It would be the Duke, the Duke would insist.|Scared of his wife.
INFO_IKENI7_00004993|Your wife would hang you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004992|Now, she's picked Liam and if he refuses her anything. Well...her last two playthings are dead, put it that way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004990|She might have made herself the Duke's plaything, but she likes to own people herself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004989|It's over now, but she can still call on him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004988|Madison was the Duke's favorite for a while.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004987|What do you mean she owns Liam?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004986|That's not going to happen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004985|You think you're getting them back?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004984|I want my shards back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004983|You want to fight? Let's fight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004982|You'd better make sure you earn yourself more Elexit in case you need to pay anyone else off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004981|I'll take your Elexit this time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004980|It seems you have learned the true language of Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004979|Take this Elexit and forget all about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004978|Come on, open your mouth and speak, which skinflap has been opening their mouth and what do they say?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004977|Don't feel you have to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004976|I'll come back another time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004974|Mess with me and you mess with the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004971|No, so don't expect any payment. You stole a life. Be grateful I don't take yours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004970|Did you leave Madison 'somewhat' alive?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004969|Iron Madison has nothing to do with this. You owe me some shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004968|Then take the shards and choke on them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004967|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004965|You really aren't out to make friends are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004964|Pay me, or more of your people are going to disappear.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004962|Because, I will have to spend shards finding a suitable replacement for her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004961|And, what happened to her means you will get nothing from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004960|But, in your case, I remember what you did to Iron Madison.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004959|I usually show my appreciation with Elexit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004958|You really don't want to be on my shit list.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004957|Unless you have something else to tell me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004956|Do I have to? Don't go acting without consulting me in future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004955|Are you putting a reward on my head?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004954|Maybe, maybe. She certainly wasn't a supporter of mine.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004953|Trust me, I did you a favor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004952|You don't get to decide what's important to me and what's not.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004950|The Duke is angry, but...you're lucky, normally he'd have someone killed for something like this, but for now... he is letting this go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004949|So, how am I supposed to unpick the truth? |
INFO_IKENI7_00004948|Other people have a different version of events.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004947|You are sticking with your story? Okay.|Thinking it through.
INFO_IKENI7_00004946|It wasn't anything to do with me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004945|So, out with it. Why did you kill her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004944|So, what? You want to piss on me and tell me it's raining?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004943|She was that important to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004942|You can't just kill our people!|
INFO_IKENI7_00004941|You're fortunate that the Duke hasn't learned of this...yet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004940|This isn't a time for lies. I know what happens in my own town.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004939|She deserved to die. I did you a favor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004938|I didn't have anything to do with it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004937|Why did you kill Iron Madison?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004936|Another asshole. Another corpse.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004935|Oh, there's every reason.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004934|There's no need to fight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004933|Enough talk, let's get this over with.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004931|Wow, have you got it wrong.|As in 'boy, are you wrong'.
INFO_IKENI7_00004930|You think I'm all talk?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004929|I'll hold you down in a bath of acid, until you start talking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004928|Threats? I'll peel the skin from your body.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004927|You can keep your threats.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004926|You should take a profit. Always take a profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004925|Or, they'd've taken shards to keep their mouths closed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004924|Most of the blowflies here wouldn't have given a shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004923|You made the right choice, telling me what's going on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004922|Would you ignore it in my place? He's my property. He calls himself my husband and he's betraying me with a whore. Tell me what you know.|Angered
INFO_IKENI7_00004921|Do you think I should ignore that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004918|Well, I'll tell you, I think she has her eye on my property. She's seduced Liam.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004917|You don't? Really?|Suspicious.
INFO_IKENI7_00004916|I don't know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004915|Liam.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004913|Of all of us, his faith is the strongest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004912|You've seen him? Hah, I don't know why I'm surprised he made it.|Surprised/relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00004911|Your missing man, Frank, he is still alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004910|I don't answer to Clerics.|Cold
INFO_IKENI7_00004908|He promised a set of shards to Bat and that dipshit of a runner believed him. Bat lasted three days in the cage, weakling.|Telling an exemplary story
INFO_IKENI7_00004907|Oh, yeah. And, if this Cleric wants to get you involved in anything don't listen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004905|Hear the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004904|He's serving as an example and he's proving useful sometimes. He has a brain the Duke wants to pick.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004903|Frank over there is a Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004900|Head directly to the pass to Abessa.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004899|Let's go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004898|About the Duke's shards...|
INFO_IKENI7_00004896|Ready to go?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004895|The pass will contain the convoy and it's far enough away from the Fort that the Duke won't know anything's happened there for a decent length of time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004894|I've thought about this and the best place to intercept the shipment is when it's coming through the pass that connects Abessa with Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004893|Good, great, that convoy won't know what hit it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004892|We're partners now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004891|Deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004889|Well, well...okay. |Flapping and surrendering
INFO_IKENI7_00004888|Yes.|Firm
INFO_IKENI7_00004887|Are you expecting me to just back down and accept this?|Blustering
INFO_IKENI7_00004886|I'm doing the fighting, I'm taking the risk. I'll take 50%.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004885|Which will mean nothing if I'm not there to get the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004884|Hey, this is my plan and I did all the prep work.|Protesting
INFO_IKENI7_00004883|Make it 50%, or there's no deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004882|If you hit that convoy, take the Elexit then I'll give you, say 40% of the take.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004881|Well, great. You could've said earlier and spared me all that talking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004879|No, I'm not going up against the Duke. Count me out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004878|And, the next delivery of shards is due soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004876|Keeping it low key is how the Duke is hoping to keep his Elexit a secret.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004873|The Duke is brining the Elexit into the Fort in deliveries with minimum muscle to protect it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004872|So, what's your plan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004871|But, it also means the Duke can't raise much of a storm if all that Elexit suddenly disappears.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004869|Hey, the shards you gave me...I've managed to earn them back. |Friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00004867|After all, it's better than me and you ending up as food for the jackals.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004866|That not only means the Elexit is out there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004865|He can't have word get round the Fort and then reach the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004864|So, because the Duke needs to keep this a secret.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004863|Keep them guessing, surprise them with your attacks and hit them with a huge bang when they are least expecting it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004862|That's why the Duke likes to play his enemies according to good old Outlaw tradition.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004861|Neither side really knows if we could win a war and besides, where's the profit for anyone? A full out war and we'll all lose.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004860|Enemies, yes, but not at war. There is a big difference.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004859|I thought the Clerics and the Outlaws were already enemies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004858|And, the Clerics believed him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004857|If he'd admitted it was Outlaws that killed those Clerics it would have started a war. So, he hid the shards and denied the whole thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004856|But, of course, he couldn't tell anyone about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004855|And, it worked! The Duke made a fortune.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004854|The Duke got wind of this and set up an ambush.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004853|The Clerics were transporting goods and Elexit between the Domed City in Abessa and the Hort in Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004852|How did the Duke get this the Elexit from the Clerics?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004851|Suit yourself then, it isn't that important.|Moving on, covering
INFO_IKENI7_00004848|What? Oh, alright, alright.|Surprised then backing down
INFO_IKENI7_00004847|If that sounds good then let's do this. If not then just pretend this conversation never happened.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004846|He's trying to bring them into the Fort little by little without anyone noticing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004845|It would bring us a lot of Elexit. And, I mean a lot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004844|And, if you have been trusted with this...maybe I could ask you about something?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004843|She must trust you if she gave you this.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00004840|Edan. You mean you met Katta?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004839|I got it in Edan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004837|No. I can't show it to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004836|Yes, please, show me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004835|Why do you want to look at that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004834|If you don't want to help a fellow because of that claw, or the shards, you might as well be on your way.|Down
INFO_IKENI7_00004833|Maybe, I got you wrong. Maybe, you just found that claw.|Cautious
INFO_IKENI7_00004832|We can take advantage of that to earn ourselves a profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004827|I know the Duke stole a pile of shards from the Clerics some time ago.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004826|Listen closely.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004823|Right, Right! Let's do this.|surprised, realising he's getting help
INFO_IKENI7_00004822|And, it means we work together, share the loot and go our separate ways, both with the shards to make life happier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004821|You're one of us, right? I mean you're playing it shy, but you know what the claw means?|Enthused
INFO_IKENI7_00004820|All right, I'm in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004817|You wouldn't have one if you hadn't earn it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004816|And, you'll trust me with this because of this claw?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004815|I'm not interested.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004812|Can I take a look at it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004811|Say, where did you get that claw?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004807|I'm sure that's enough tribute to keep you free from another visit from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004806|Yes, that will make the boss feel a lot happier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004805|There, is that enough?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004804|I know, I know, you're looking at me and not feeling that threatened if you don't pay, but the Duke stands behind me. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004801|Why would I risk my neck to lie?! I told you I don't want to be here. |Pleading.
INFO_IKENI7_00004800|There's no tax. This is a con.|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00004799|Really. You don't want to explain not paying to the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004798|So, will you hand over the shards now? It'd be better for both of us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004796|Everyone has to pay tribute to the Duke, our glorious leader, King of the Desert and lord of the Outlaws.|Nervous.
INFO_IKENI7_00004795|I know it feels like a lot, but I didn't make the rules. That was the Duke, our glorious leader, King of the Desert and lord of the Outlaws.|Racing through the titles
INFO_IKENI7_00004794|That's only half the amount I need, that the Duke needs for the tribute.|Nervous.
INFO_IKENI7_00004793|That's...that's not enough I'm afraid.|Nervous.
INFO_IKENI7_00004791|But, if I don't get him the shards, he'll put a rope round my neck. Or, my wife will. She'd do it for him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004790|So? What is that to do with me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004789|Here, take the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004788|You are asking me to pay to be here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004787|So, do a guy a favor and hand over the money.|Appealing
INFO_IKENI7_00004786|Look, I've told the Duke a thousand times I'm not the guy for this.|Tired, unenthusiastic
INFO_IKENI7_00004785|And, I...am here to collect them.|Tired, unenthusiastic
INFO_IKENI7_00004784|I don't know if anyone's told you, but the Duke, our glorious leader, King of the Desert, is raising taxes on his territory.|Tired, unenthusiastic
INFO_IKENI7_00004782|Hey you. You are new here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004780|And, if I can get back to them, I can get you a reward.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004778|I'm going to find my unit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004775|This feels like a trick. You'll put a bullet in my head as soon as I try and leave, won't you? You, or Iron Madison.|Sudden distrust
INFO_IKENI7_00004774|I mean...go. Leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004773|What do you mean, go?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004772|I've paid the ransom money. You can go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004771|Go to the Cleric and tell him I will allow him to leave the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004770|So, don't fuck it up and get in my bad books some other way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004769|Hah, alright. I wanted to test you and you held firm.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004768|You won't get more from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004767|But, you Clerics are swimming in shards. Surely, you'll pay more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004766|You aren't prepared to pay more for his life?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004765|Here, will that pay for Frank's release?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004764|Find the rest, or don't come back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004763|Then you keep your shards and I'll keep your Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004762|And, if that's all I have?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004761|You get to pay an amount that I won't find insulting.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004760|You don't get to name a price.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004759|I look after my people here. And, we have opportunities for all those who stay here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004757|Before you go, here's some well-meaning advice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004754|You've been smart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004753|Just remember how this played out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004752|Hah. I've changed my mind, you can keep the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004751|Here is the Elexit for Frank.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004749|And, I told you nothing happens in Tavar without profit. So, pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004748|You said you don't need shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004747|Pay me and he can go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004746|They should be worrying about Xacor not Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004745|So, give me the shards and tell him that I guarantee him free passage. Ignadon should know my generosity. Tell them to stay at home and stop meddling in the business of Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004744|All in the service of Calaan...|Sceptical of the religion
INFO_IKENI7_00004743|Of course, Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004742|That they should be worrying about Xacor not Tavar.|Quoting what he wants them to think.
INFO_IKENI7_00004741|Tell him he can go, but he's to carry a message back to Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004740|We want to know if he's a threat, or if he'll start talking to us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004739|Now, this Duke and his men, they came out of nowhere and they've destabilized the whole of Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004738|Baxter might have been a maniac, but at least he talked to us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004737|Ever since the Duke took over here the lines of communication with Ignadon have been shut down.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004736|To find out what's happening.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004735|Why are you here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004734|Maybe, letting him go will send them a signal.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00004733|Come to Tavar and you will pay the price, stay at home in the Hort and you have nothing to fear from me.'|Lying
INFO_IKENI7_00004731|But, I have no more use for him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004729|You think I 'need' whatever you can offer? Look around you, asshole.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004728|You should choose your friends better.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004727|He's a friend. I owe him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004726|Do you want answers, or do you want the Elexit I offered you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004725|Why do you want him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004724|I want to buy Frank's freedom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004723|She obviously needs to be reminded how the hierarchy works here in the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004722|I guess I'll find out when I reprimand her. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004721|So, I guess we don't need to worry about what she thinks any more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004720|I guess it will have to remain a mystery seeing as she's dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004719|Oh, is she jealous that he worshipped me, or angry that he's dead?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004718|Then so be it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004717|If killing Madison is the only way to get rid of her...|
INFO_IKENI7_00004716|Yes, I've spoken to her, she wants Madison dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004715|And, I'm the one to teach him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004713|I suspected Liam was running to her behind my back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004710|Cindy, she wants you dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004707|You like to talk, don't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004706|I'll break every damn bone in your body.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004705|You think you can withhold information from me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004704|Why does she want me dead?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004703|That little slut?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004697|So, speak up. Who has been bad mouthing me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004696|That's just because I'm the one who is prepared to get my hands dirty getting things done|
INFO_IKENI7_00004695|Is that right?|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00004694|From what I've heard, you haven't got the best reputation.|Squaring up, aggressive.
INFO_IKENI7_00004692|But, if you get her to attack you, well...I think he'd be glad to be rid of her. She's trouble for him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004691|And, If you just went and attacked her he'd be forced to act.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004690|And, if she attacks you, not even the Duke will blame you for defending yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004689|If you provoke her, she'll take the bait for sure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004688|Well, everyone knows she loves to start fights.|Thinking
INFO_IKENI7_00004687|How do you suggest I kill her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004686|You'll have to find a way to get rid of her discreetly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004685|And, I should warn you that killing her openly risks the Duke coming after all of us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004684|It won't be easy to kill her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004683|Yes. I've said. You will be rewarded, I can promise you that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004682|If you really want to help me, you have to kill her for me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004681|I wouldn't stand a chance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004680|If I could've done it myself, don't you think I would have done it an age ago?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004679|If you want her dead, you'll have to kill her yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004678|You'll have to pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004677|And, I won't tell anybody that you want to help a Cleric.|Playful smile, can't be too threatening
INFO_IKENI7_00004676|Then we are agreed? You'll kill her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004675|Frank, the Cleric wants her dead too. I could help you both.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004674|Otherwise ,she'll come after him, after you, after me. There's no other way to end this, but to kill her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004672|I mean, you have to know there is only one way to help. Iron Madison has to die. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004671|You'll help? For real?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004670|How can I help?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004668|People like me never get justice. Life's taken everything I had left. My fate's been decided already.|Devastated
INFO_IKENI7_00004667|You don't want revenge?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004665|There's nothing left to be said. Go on, what are you staring at?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004664|Then you can go.|Devastated
INFO_IKENI7_00004663|It's the truth.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004662|If that's supposed to be a joke...|
INFO_IKENI7_00004661|Liam is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004660|If there is an afterlife, I hope she's burning in it.|Anger
INFO_IKENI7_00004659|Oh, you don't know how long I've hoped to hear those words.|Realising it's true and letting emotion come through
INFO_IKENI7_00004658|Dead? Dead, for real? Dead and never coming back?|Wary, hoping
INFO_IKENI7_00004657|Iron Madison is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004656|Someone I know, Liam, he's in trouble. Iron Madison has got her claws into him. I mean, I mean she owns him. She treats him like he's her slave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004655|If...If I tell you, I'm trusting you with my life but...|
INFO_IKENI7_00004654|What help do you need?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004653|You help me, I can help you. Do you understand?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004651|Well, I'm just saying we can come to an arrangement. You can pay, or... Maybe you can help me in return?|Trying to get back to sales mode. Deciding to start to push her own agenda - to get help with Liam
INFO_IKENI7_00004650|It sounds like you're trying to pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004649|I can make it worth your while.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004647|Are you sure?|Getting nervous, she needs help.
INFO_IKENI7_00004646|I don't want anything from a prostitute.|Cold plus one
INFO_IKENI7_00004644|I just want you to tell me what you want. I can make it worth your while. Really...think about it, we can make an arrangement.|Trying to get back to sales mode. Deciding to start to push her own agenda - to get help with Liam
INFO_IKENI7_00004643|Yes, look, honestly...I'm fine.|Recovering, flustered.
INFO_IKENI7_00004642|Of course.|Realising she's let her emotions show (she's upset about Liam).
INFO_IKENI7_00004641|Sounds like you're the one who lost something. Are you all right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004639|Hartmut...he believed in his men. He was a good commander. One of the best Legates in the Hort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004636|Then all this was for nothing. There is no way out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004635|I've already found them. Hartmut is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004634|I'm going to find my unit. They're my way out of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004633|So, look for him if you are short of Elexit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004632|And if you can make it back to my unit, Hartmut will show his appreciation for me. I am certain of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004631|These Outlaws stripped anything of value from me when I was captured.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004629|But, you have my thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004628|But, thank you. I'm sorry I can't give you anything as a reward|
INFO_IKENI7_00004627|I'll still have to pick my moment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004626|That will make it much easier to escape.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004625|Madison is dead?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004624|Madison is dead. You can make your escape.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004622|I've been watching them for a while now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004621|Let me decide how to handle this. Tell me about the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004620|Shards will speak louder than words.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004619|Hartmut gave you the shards to pay the ransom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004618|If you don't...I think I will die here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004617|Just get me out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004616|If you could find a way to get her called away somewhere else|
INFO_IKENI7_00004615|That's all I need to know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004614|Any other ideas for how to get you out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004613|Are there any other options?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004612|Maybe, we could make use of her enmity towards my guard, Iron Madison.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004611|Cindy, a girl from the entertainment district, she hates Iron Madison more than I do.|Thinking it through
INFO_IKENI7_00004610|They hadn't completed their mission, so they might still be there. And, if our group commander is still alive, he might have some ideas on how to get me out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004609|Or...maybe you could find the rest of my unit in the Wastelands?|coming up with a new option
INFO_IKENI7_00004608|I knew Calaan would not desert me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004607|You can't miss it once you're in there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004606|That Elexit is to buy the freedom of my friend. Don't let it go astray.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004605|Very well. I will put our man's fate in your hands.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004604|A tower up in the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004603|He's normally up in the biggest building in Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004602|Where can I find the Duke?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004601|Give me the Elexit, I'll pay to get your man out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004599|If we offer enough, the Duke should agree to set him free.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004598|Elexit is the only thing they respect.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004597|Well, we can't just ask them. The Outlaws aren't going to suddenly start abiding by old agreements from the Great Council of Magalan.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00004596|What's your plan for getting your man out of the Fort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004595|It's not like they'll trust you, but they'll allow you in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004594|The Outlaws are used to people passing through. They welcome all in the name of profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004591|The question is - why would you help us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004590|As you're an Outlaw, no one is going to suspect you if you do some checking for us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004589|So, they won't give me a chance to enter the Fort. Do you think you can get in without a problem?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004588|This is my third mission out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004587|They don't see all our order as enemies, but they know my face and that I'm part of a reconnaissance group.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004586|You probably stand more chance than us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004585|I want to get Frank home safely and I fear if I go in after him, I'll just get him killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004584|Right now, I'll take whatever help I can get.|Cautious
INFO_IKENI7_00004583|Can I help you get your man back?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004582|The least I can do is pay you for the help you've given.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004581|You've accomplished what a squad of Clerics could not.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004579|Though honor is payment enough. Shards help with more worldy problems.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004578|You have proved your loyalty to us and to Calaan. In Calaan and in each other we trust.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004577|This should pay for your help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004576|Words are nothing, but Elexit is all, hey?|Guessing the player's real motive.
INFO_IKENI7_00004575|Thank you, you've saved a good man.|Relieved, grateful
INFO_IKENI7_00004574|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004573|And, you got him free?|Surprised, grateful
INFO_IKENI7_00004572|Your man, Frank, has been freed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004571|Here. For bringing me this news.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004570|He's not exactly making it easy to complete his work here on Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004569|For all his wisdom, I hope Calaan sees fit to leave me more men here in the future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004568|One more believer goes to Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004567|He is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004566|Those dogs killed him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004565|The captive Cleric is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004564|Either way, it's a risky venture for us all. And, we don't even know if he's still alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004563|We're going to have to find a way into that Fort, then we'll have shoot our way out, or we'll need to get one man inside to sneak him out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004562|I'm not leaving anyone behind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004561|We've come back here to regroup.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004560|Several dead, one man taken prisoner.|Annoyed with himself
INFO_IKENI7_00004559|But, I don't think that's really an option.|Calming
INFO_IKENI7_00004558|Maybe, but now I'll kill every last damned Outlaw if I have to.|Angered
INFO_IKENI7_00004557|You cost yourself your men by underestimating the enemy.|Harsh plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00004556|You've taken casualties?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004555|We've lost too many men realizing what the real threat these Outlaws are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004554|And, the third time we've been hit by surprise attacks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004552|But, it just makes them unpredictable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004551|You'd think dealing with undisciplined Outlaws would be easy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004550|Tavar, the garbage dump of Magalan.|Grim, reflecting
INFO_IKENI7_00004549|You seem worried.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004548|Making your presence known in Tavar is an invitation for trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004546|I'll have to make sure we take better care from now on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004545|Regrettably, I think we have a lot to learn when it comes to fieldcraft.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004544|An accident? I hope that's true.|Wary, but relaxing a little.
INFO_IKENI7_00004543|Yes, you have a point...|Wary, but relaxing a little.
INFO_IKENI7_00004542|You should be asking why your sentries didn't spot me earlier. You need to sort out your security.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004540|By accident, I was just travelling through here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004539|How did you find us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004537|So, I will ask you again...|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00004536|You've walked onto our ground.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004535|I don't know the password.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004534|I'm on your side. I'm a Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004532|Halt! Who are you? What's the password?|Military professional
INFO_IKENI7_00004531|You'll have to set him free.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004530|But, I want no part of this.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00004529|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004527|You want to question the Duke?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004526|What? Why the hell would he say that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004523|The Duke said Frank can go free.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004522|If you're looking for entertainment try the entertainment district. It's in the name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004521|You've got five seconds to start talking about the Elexit you've brought with you.|Sarcastic, assessing the player
INFO_IKENI7_00004520|And, it shows everyone here that the Duke bows to no one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004519|It's safer to force the information out of this asshole than to send a patrol to Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004518|Things about the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004516|What can the prisoner tell the Duke?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004515|It's me, not Calaan who decides the pain he feels and whether he gets to live...|
INFO_IKENI7_00004512|This Cleric knows that. He knows he needs to give up his secrets.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004511|Hah, he prays to me. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004510|So, who's more powerful, you, or Calaan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004509|His friends ran, we took this one prisoner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004508|They soon learned the Duke is more powerful than Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004507|The Clerics sent some of Calaan's little soldiers over the border.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004506|How did Frank get here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004505|But, a slit throat and a shallow grave does that better.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004504|Sometimes to serve as an example to others.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004503|Only where there's a profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004501|Do you take many prisoners?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004499|Bow to the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004495|Anyone who messes with the Duke, ends up in there. If they're lucky.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004493|Asshole storage.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004492|What's the cage for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004490|Time for you to move on. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004489|The cage is off limits without my special permission.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004486|A Berserker? Oh, good. Come to persuade us of the joy of trees? Is it true you guys actually fuck them?|Sarcastic, assessing the player
INFO_IKENI7_00004484|A Cleric? Oh, we love of Clerics here in Tavar. It's the squeaking sounds you make when we bury you head down in an anthill.|Sarcastic, assessing the player
INFO_IKENI7_00004483|That's what we're going to find out.|Weighing the player up
INFO_IKENI7_00004482|Is there a problem?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004480|Hey! Stay right there.|Commanding, used to being obeyed
INFO_IKENI7_00004479|Are you going to do what he asks, or not?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004478|Then, why am I still sitting here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004477|He tasked me with buying your freedom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004476|Well, if he trusts you with a message then my mistrust of you was unwarranted. Please, tell me what did he say to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004475|What can I say? It must be my charisma. Do you want to know what he said?|Deadpan
INFO_IKENI7_00004474|Our group commander is alive? That is good news!|
INFO_IKENI7_00004473|And, he spoke to you? To an outsider?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004472|You found our group commander?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004471|I spoke with Hartmut.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004469|But, I don't know how you'd manage to do that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004468|And, Calaan will provide, won't he, brother?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004467|Speak. Calaan tells us to listen, so, I will listen.|Wise
INFO_IKENI7_00004466|What is this? You want to talk me to death now, is that it?|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00004465|Only in body. My mind and spirit are free.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004463|No. Not that I can see.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004462|Well, you could always talk to them? If you think you could and persuade the Outlaws to let me go without a fight?|Not holding out much hope
INFO_IKENI7_00004461|That could give me a chance to make a break for it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004460|The main problem is that beast of a woman, Iron Madison, watches me closely.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004459|While I haven't found a way out, now that Calaan has sent you to help me, maybe there could be ways to get out of here if you would be prepared to help me.|Thinking it through
INFO_IKENI7_00004458|Only, because you need more faith in Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004457|Then I don't see how I can help you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004455|So, do you have any idea how you can escape?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004454|You're lucky you weren't killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004453|They beat me to a pulp and I woke up here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004452|To make matters worse, the direction I fled in led me straight into the hands of a group of Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004451|But, my patrol was attacked by mantids and I got separated from the rest of my unit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004450|We came here to get information about the armaments and defensive strength of the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004448|I was a member of a recon group here in Tavar. I was out on patrol when I was captured.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004447|Then let me tell you what happened to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004446|But, they actually seem to know what they're doing.|Grudging respect
INFO_IKENI7_00004445|I was hoping this undisciplined rabble would make a mistake.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004444|But, I haven't observed any real errors they've made with their patrols.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004443|How can I persuade the Outlaws to let you go?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004442|As my brother-in-arms, it is your duty to get me out of here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004441|It wasn't luck, it was Calaan. He guided me here and now he has brought you to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004440|Ah, so you weren't taken prisoner?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004439|No. I came here of my own accord.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004436|I was sent to buy your freedom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004435|Unless you were sent here by my Legate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004433|So, leave me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004431|I have no reason to tell you anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004430|Then my words would be wasted on you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004429|May Calaan watch over you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004428|Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004427|How were you captured?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004426|Calaan will punish you all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004425|I won't waste words on an unbeliever.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004424|Watch your step, brother. You might be free now, but you can't trust these Outlaws. They live only for profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004422|You're a prisoner here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004421|Don't mess with the Scrap Baron.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004420|All scrap must go to Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004419|Dirty Clerics. They all have to die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004418|Work, listen, obey the will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004417|I got my head back. What the fuck happened?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004416|Work, listen, obey the will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004415|Our faith makes us strong.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004414|But, somehow they find a way to stay alive out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004413|These Outlaws are assholes. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004412|We serve Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004411|Life goes by too fast to just stand around. Get out there and seize it!|
INFO_IKENI7_00004410|Thanks. Information is always useful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004409|Well, I won't keep you any longer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004408|A man of the sword and not the word.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004407|Interesting. Not many people seem to think about what the Albs want.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00004406|No, not at all. They just want the technology. Interest is...emotional. The past is something that's gone. They want the future. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004405|They're interested in the Old World?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004404|They have found some fragments of Old World information. They're using that knowledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004403|They still consume Elex, but they are given a command role.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004401|An interest in history. The Elexetors, well I don't know for sure, but...|Covering his knowledge
INFO_IKENI7_00004400|Me? What have I got in common with Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004399|That's because you and them have something in common.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004398|That they have as good as, or better knowledge of technology than the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004397|So, the rumors say. What else do you know about the Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004396|Yes. They are names to be feared. Though, I had heard that Jax had disappeared.|The player character is Jax, travelling incognito.
INFO_IKENI7_00004395|Or, Jax. Have you heard of them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004394|You mean like Wardek and Kallax?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004393|Then you've heard of the Elexetors? They rule in Xacor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004392|That was very informative. Thank you!|
INFO_IKENI7_00004391|That's all I know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004390|Not all of them, some operate alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004388|It reduces the chances. That's one of the reasons Albs are so successful. They operate together without question.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004387|So, it means no one can argue with orders?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004386|Elex keeps them clear thinking, it removes the emotions that could get in the way of orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004385|Greater strength, lower levels of fatigue, reduced pain. It turns men into fighting machines. And, not just physically. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004384|It makes them stronger of course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004381|Now, I am curious. Do you know why they use Elex?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004380|Maybe, I could tell you a story about them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004379|Hardly anyone knows anything about them, I mean other than about their attacks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004378|What do you know about the Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004377|Correct. I don't have time to share stories.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004376|And, I don't think you are the storytelling type.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004375|The only thing I am interested in is stories.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004374|Don't waste your time on my old bones.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004373|No, no. I am okay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004372|Is there something you need?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004370|Maybe, I'll even get this light tower working. A man needs something to do in life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004368|I think I will get comfortable here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004367|How long are you going to stay here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004366|Then I have something up my sleeve if I ever get into any difficulties again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004365|Here, take the weapon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004364|Here, take your shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004362|So, yes, all right, you can have it.|Giving in
INFO_IKENI7_00004361|Well, you had a beer for me.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00004360|We help each other out, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004359|There, take it. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004358|You killed him, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004357|Well, maybe Calaan will bring him back from the dead to haunt me, otherwise...I'm safe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004356|And, you are sure of that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004355|Because, that Cleric won't look for it anymore.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004354|But, give me a little Elexit for the trade, at least.|A little uncomfortable asking
INFO_IKENI7_00004353|Well, okay. Then you should have it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004352|He is only interested in the weapon, not you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004351|And...do you think that is a good idea?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004350|I want to give it to Volkmar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004349|Sure, you take your time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004348|You want paying? I'll think about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004347|Here, take the damn thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004346|The Clerics are after this weapon, it would be much better to let you have it. You're right. I should just stick to hunting for scrap.|Falling under suggestion
INFO_IKENI7_00004344|The Clerics are after that weapon, it would be much better to let me have it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004343|Some shards for me, a shiny Cleric's weapon for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004342|I'll make you a trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004341|All right, all right I don't really need this thing anyway.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004340|Because, you're a survivor and you don't want to get me pissed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004339|Why should I give it to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004338|Give me the Cleric's weapon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004337|That's why I thought I'd head for the beacon. Get some scrap and get myself back to Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004336|Now those Clerics are out hunting for me, you can hear their horns.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004335|And, I got away with their leader's weapon. I think that must've made them angry.|Amused, wry
INFO_IKENI7_00004332|I'm here aren't I? I waited until it was dark and I got out. I guess they thought I was too old to guard. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004331|I just wish I'd had their legs for running. The Clerics caught up with me and took me prisoner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004330|They think running away is the wrong thing to do, yet...here I am at my age.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004329|They didn't make the same choice. That's the problem with some people of their age. They think every fight is winnable.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004328|You might not like the choice, but I'm still alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004327|Look I'm still here aren't I? |
INFO_IKENI7_00004326|Yeah. And, then afterwards, I could have gone and defeated the Albs on my own.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004325|You should have fought.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004324|What happened to the scrap collectors?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004323|I didn't want to chance a fight with them, they were much better armed. So, I got out of there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004322|On our way there we got ambushed by a group of Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004321|They needed a lead, I needed some help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004320|I know these lands better than to come alone. I was travelling with a pair of scrap collectors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004319|That wasn't the plan, no.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004318|My age? Hah, age is bullshit. Wrinkled, or smooth skinned, life throws the same shit at you.|With a smile.
INFO_IKENI7_00004317|Brave for someone at your age.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004316|You came out here on your own?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004315|So, I look for ruins, visit the beacons and I find things to earn shards, so I don't need anyone else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004314|I've seen leaders come and go in the Fort and there's only one constant - you have to rely on yourself!|
INFO_IKENI7_00004310|They used to be a cry for help. Or, a way to give help, direction, guidance...|
INFO_IKENI7_00004309|What are you doing out here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004308|There are always other sides to everything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004307|That's one side of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004306|Is that it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004305|I guess they must have fixed whatever the problem was with their fighting machines, it's never happened again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004304|Instead, there were yet more deaths. There aren't numbers, but I'd guess at least half of those still alive were killed, but that's a guess.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004303|The Clerics numbers never recovered.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004302|Those left retreated into Ignadon. Anyone that didn't make it back, was cut down by one Faction, or another.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004301|They were defeated. Heavy losses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004300|They went in to battle with the Berserkers and their machines shut down.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004299|But, either their prayers weren't answers, or they had a technological hitch...|
INFO_IKENI7_00004298|They put their faith in their fighting machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004297|The wars.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004296|Why do the Clerics have so few men?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004295|So, why invent a lot of hocus pocus to go with it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004294|Everything else they do is about knowledge and fact and observation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004293|Why they've created a god and worship technology? Well, I can't understand it.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00004292|But, this god they believe in, Calaan? I haven't seen anything anywhere about this god in records from before the Comet hit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004291|Secretive lot. They probably know more about history than the others, but they keep it to themselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004290|How much do you know about the Clerics?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004289|Well, they'll change it, but whether Magalan was ever like they say, that's just a fantasy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004288|They want to use their magic to turn the clock back and 'make Magalan what it was'. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004287|It seems the Pilgrim wants to purify all of Edan. They're going to use their World Hearts to change the world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004286|The Berserkers used to stay in Edan, mostly. They'd fight to protect their borders, make assaults outside them then pull back. Now, they're holding ground.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004284|It was some guy called Amrek that started them. The new guy they have there, Thorald, the Pilgrim sees himself as some sort of spiritual successor to Amrek. He has changed things there, they're pushing out into the world more than they did.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004282|I want to be a long way from here if those things ever go off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004281|That's why I want shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004280|What happened to the prisoners, the dead...history doesn't speak of that. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004279|The Albs captured people, land, built their Converters before the Factions could respond.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004278|They built their strength and then they invaded. The Factions were taken completely by surprise. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004277|They were just a small splinter group. They went up into Xacor, into the ice and no groups were interested in that land.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004276|The Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004275|So, what went wrong?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004274|All the Factions rebuilt their lands, worked on their own rules.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004273|But, the leaders brought their people back into line. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004272|There are always some hotheads, some isolated clashes over resources.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004271|So, the peace lasted, more, or less.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004270|But, after all the deaths the Factions knew they risked their own destruction if they fought any more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004269|Well, peace is always fragile. The Berserkers and Clerics have totally different ideas about Elex and Technology for a start...|
INFO_IKENI7_00004268|A non-aggression treaty? That doesn't seem to have worked.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004267|Everyone else was fighting for what was left, but they decided to make something new.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004266|They were a group living up in the woods, trying to grow their own food and they evolved from there. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004265|What do you know about the Berserkers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004264|Finally, the people in charge realized the cost was too high, so they formed a Council, the Great Council of Magalan and made a non-aggression treaty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004263|Any small factions that were left got absorbed, or destroyed. I mean these people were survivors, so you'd think that's what they'd want - to survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004262|Anyway, instead of fighting over a one or two tins, the Factions started fighting over land, Elex, resources. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004261|I guess as soon as you're a group, you want to start keeping a history of you are. History becomes more important.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004260|Well, some. There were more records kept during the Territory Wars. That was once the Factions had formed and started fighting each other.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004259|At least you did listen. That is not always the case today.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004258|I have heard enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004257|So, there are a lot of gaps in your knowledge of history?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004256|All factions think they've got ways to 'save' us. They're all just ways people are trying to survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004255|But, it didn't take long for people to form groups to get resources. And, it didn't take long for those people to start fighting.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004254|No leaders, all the things they relied on to survive had gone. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004253|There aren't really records from after the Comet hit, no one was writing things down, they were just trying to survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004252|But, the Comet destroyed all that. |
INFO_IKENI7_00004251|Before that there were countries and governments. Millions of people organized into groups, nothing like now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004250|Well, they're recent history, I mean they only came about after the Comet hit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004249|Tell me about the Factions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004248|Hell, maybe the Clerics, or someone knows about those bombs already, maybe someone will try and set them off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004247|Maybe, it takes an earthquake, but there's a real risk there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004246|I know it doesn't feel safe knowing they are there! Maybe all it takes is a mistake.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004244|I don't know. Big explosions, 'big' explosions. And, the Fort is sitting on top of them|
INFO_IKENI7_00004243|How could they do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004242|But, these things were supposed to destroy cities. They were supposed to destroy countries!|
INFO_IKENI7_00004241|I know the history, not the science, I'm no Cleric.|Shake of the head
INFO_IKENI7_00004240|You think the Fort will blow up?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004239|What kind of weapons?|
INFO_IKENI7_00004238|When the sand shifts other buildings appear. And, then all the things that were left in them are there for the taking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004237|But, not everything was destroyed. Some building complexes like the Fort survived. Others were buried.|
INFO_IKENI7_00004236|Back before the Comet hit they stored weapons there. Serious, end of the world weapons. And, they're still there, somewhere, along with a whole stack of the usual kind.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003951|Or, if you don't want the hassle of talking to the little man, you can sell the I.O.U.'s to a dealer for a few shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003950|You show the I.O.U. to each of them, say they've passed the payment deadline and they will have to pay up, no argument.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003949|Because, I have the I.O.U.s. Signed, sealed, promised and ready for collection.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003948|How does this help me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003947|They owe the Fort favors. They have to do those, or they have to pay.|Enthusiastic
INFO_IKENI7_00003946|You see, I know a few people who have run up 'debts'.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003945|Then, I have some great advice for you.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003943|No, I'm not doing that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003942|I want shards in my pocket.|plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00003941|What would you think about getting rich at the expense of someone else?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003940|You won't get a rematch. Are you ready?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003939|Okay, you got one shot, if you think you can take it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003938|Next time, prove you're a fighter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003937|He made you look like an idiot out there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003936|Looks like Gunn is past it as a fighter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003934|Oh, and don't worry, I've put the word out, the whole Fort knows. You'll get no Elexit and no honor. That's what you get for picking fights you're not ready for.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003933|You fought and lost against a guy so drugged he could hardly stand.|Mocking
INFO_IKENI7_00003930|So, what other advice have you got?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003929|You should get you an easy fight and an easy win.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003928|Just don't let him over do it with the booze, or the stims. Dead men don't pay.|Warning
INFO_IKENI7_00003926|So, before you fight him, get him drunk. Just convince him to take a shot, or two.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003925|Whoa, wait for it, that's not the advice you paid for, that comes now. You see, Ike is through, gone, career over. And, that's because he's hooked on anything you can think of.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003922|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003921|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003920|Have you challenged Ike in the Arena yet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003919|You've destroyed me. You've left me fucking nothing. Not a fucking thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003918|Why did I let you talk me into that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003917|Remember, this is the only shot you get at me!|
INFO_IKENI7_00003916|I can't fight you until you've had that fight!|
INFO_IKENI7_00003915|There is still someone waiting on you in there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003914|Yeah. You can challenge me, but I won't fight you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003913|Now, that is a proper investment.|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00003912|It's good to find a serious investor, someone who understands what this is really about.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003911|We can really do something with this. |

INFO_IKENI7_00003898|Oh, I know, you're thinking 'price'. But, you should be thinking 'return'. You should be thinking profit.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003896|I want to earn, not pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003895|Ah, you want some advice? Well, advice is investment, so how much do you want to invest in my advice?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003894|How can I earn a few shards here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003893|I hope you bring yourself and the rest of us good profits.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003876|But, yeah, you beat me. So, now you can go and get your shards from Big Jim.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003875|Aw, shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003871|You'll have to try harder than that if you want to fight Big Jim for his cash.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003869|Man...that wasn't what I needed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003868|Forget it.|If you come back and challenge without the right conditions in place.

INFO_IKENI7_00003793|Hey, you look like someone who knows the value of shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003792|Hey.|Note, Ike is stoned, this needs to carry through in his performance. He is desperate for money. A faded fighter needing money for his next fix.
INFO_IKENI7_00003791|And, that means people won't cross the Duke if it risks them ending up in the Arena with me. And the Duke knows the Arena will earn him shards, because people want to see me.|Well practiced boasts
INFO_IKENI7_00003790|People shit their pants when they hear they have to face me.|Well practiced boasts
INFO_IKENI7_00003789|I own the Arena here. |Well practiced boasts
INFO_IKENI7_00003787|I'm Big Jim. Big...Jim.|As if the player character should have heard of him.

INFO_IKENI7_00003784|Believe in the Big Jim plan and feel the power inside you.|Self-advertising.
INFO_IKENI7_00003783|They know I have enough followers to sweep all the other factions from Magalan.|Self-advertising.

INFO_IKENI7_00003776|Then, you fight.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003767|What do you do here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003765|I'll keep the prize shards as compensation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003764|Still, you didn't have to kill him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003762|That's what the Arena is for.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003759|Oh, you're here to make a claim. Here, take your pay out.|Unenthusiastic
INFO_IKENI7_00003758|But, it doesn't in the Arena. So, you don't get anything from me here, apart from maybe a bit of respect.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003757|I know that works in life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003756|You broke the rules.|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00003755|And, what does that get me?|

INFO_IKENI7_00003748|So, you fight alone?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003747|And, like I said, you want to fight me, you gotta fight them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003746|But, Ike and Gunn are the only full-timers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003745|Well, there might be others you can persuade.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003743|And, you'll need to be working for the Duke, while he's in charge, only Outlaws get to fight me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003742|Not until you've proved yourself by fighting Ike and Gunn.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003741|So, I can challenge you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003740|If you think you got what it takes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003739|You might find a few others.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003738|Then there's Ike and Gunn.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003736|Who can I challenge?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003735|You lose, you take the injuries and you take them like a man.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003671|And his brother has inherited the debt.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003670|But, I still need that debt paying.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003669|A little decency is in order.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003668|Of course not. But, you don't go calling the dead names like 'asshole', 'cheat', 'jumped up little, mantid prick' 'rolling sack of fetid raptor shit' or things like that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003667|Are you serious?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003666|He was a good, upcoming guy.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003664|Ace is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003663|He's away, out of the Fort at the moment. Leave that where he can find it and our problem will be over.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003629|I left it in your shack.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003628|Where is it?|Wary, the Trash Baron isn't know for being generous.
INFO_IKENI7_00003627|A casket? |
INFO_IKENI7_00003626|Man...and to think they told me not to play the Baron, they'll eat those words now.|Still not believing his luck - he's won!
INFO_IKENI7_00003625|Right, right, well take it to my place will you? I'll wait till my brother gets back to open it. We share everything. This is a new start for both of us.|Wary, the Trash Baron isn't know for being generous.

INFO_IKENI7_00003618|And, they said not to play him...|Not believing his luck!
INFO_IKENI7_00003617|The Scrap Baron wants to settle his gambling debts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003616|The bosses gamble with our lives, so why shouldn't we earn off it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003615|Well, if you can guess, you can bet on it with me. You see I run a book on which Runners will do a job and which will make it through alive. Among other things.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003614|It's a risky life. But, that also brings opportunities. Who knows which Runner will make it through alive and which won't?|Back into selling his betting business
INFO_IKENI7_00003613|You know, I take messages, or things from one place to another. Make sure they get there safe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003612|Some of it, but you've got to have your place here in the Fort. I'm a Runner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003611|Is this game how you earn a living?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003610|I never play without him around.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003606|No? Are you sure? You could win some shards, you could win big.|Tailing off after you know, can't think of the word for exaggerating. Back to selling the opportunity
INFO_IKENI7_00003605|I'm not playing your game.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003604|What's your brother got to do with it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003603|Though, we'll have to wait until my brother gets here.|A little sad, missing his brother.

INFO_IKENI7_00003600|Ah, I knew you were one of the good ones.|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00003599|Here, buy some yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003598|I said I 'could' not 'would', but hey, if you want some I know how you can get the shards, all you need to do is 'play the game'.|Leading up to selling 'the game'
INFO_IKENI7_00003597|Oh, yeah? Well then buy me some stims.|Firm
INFO_IKENI7_00003596|I could put a tab down for the whole Fort if I wanted.|Protesting
INFO_IKENI7_00003595|Hey, I'm not begging here.|Offending
INFO_IKENI7_00003594|I'm not buying you drugs.|Flat
INFO_IKENI7_00003593|But, say, we got off on the wrong start. So, as you're not from round here, maybe I could make it up by introducing you to 'the game'?|Backing down
INFO_IKENI7_00003592|Hey, I was just curious. That tech you're carrying screams loud that you're not from around here. But, you know, keep the personals to yourself, I'm not the intrusive type.|Defensive
INFO_IKENI7_00003591|Yeah, yeah, I do. Come on, you can pop me one of Doc's stims to keep me awake while you yabber.|Friendly
INFO_IKENI7_00003590|What's with the questions?|Hostile
INFO_IKENI7_00003589|You want to know my story?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003588|Have you been racking up some of Doc's downers? Come on, what's your story?|Positive, drawing the player in. Ace is a chancer
INFO_IKENI7_00003587|You look wired, man, I mean, super intense. |Observing
INFO_IKENI7_00003586|Look for him there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003585|Near Chloe's Bar in the entertainment district. He's always looking for more suckers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003584|Where does Ace usually hang out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003583|Put them on the table, or somewhere obvious.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003573|My name counts where it has to and that means paying your debts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003572|Maybe, maybe not, but I lost and people saw that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003571|How much do you owe him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003570|Did he cheat?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003569|I might forget he was lucky and get angry with the fast dealing bastard.|Trying to play the honorable man
INFO_IKENI7_00003567|Maybe too lucky. I lost big to him the other day. And, I've got to clear that debt, but I don't feel like seeing him.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00003566|He always gets lucky in cards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003565|Ace.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003564|Who do you owe?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003563|So, I need you to sort out what I owe.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003560|I need a debt paying.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003559|Just tell me what you want doing?|

INFO_IKENI7_00003554|Get it done right.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003549|Get this done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003548|Don't fuck up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003547|That's single-minded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003546|Any other opportunities for profits?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003545|Trust nothing. None of this is real, none of it!|
INFO_IKENI7_00003544|Or, did Bill survive long enough to give you my greeting card?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003542|How long will they obey you for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003541|As long as I want it. In their eyes I am their new god.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003540|You have to keep your orders simple, but if you do, even an Outlaw can understand what they must do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003539|They'll take any order I suggest to them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003538|These weak-minded Outlaws cannot stand against Calaan's will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003537|We have 'persuaded' those who found us to keep our presence a secret.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003536|You should be more worried about the Outlaws attacking you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003535|So, are you an Outlaw?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003534|Why would you hide the answer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003533|Why do you want to know?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003532|But, it's best if you stay away from that island, unless you want your head scrambled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003531|You think the Scrap Baron will be interested in your excuses?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003530|I can't, I don't have a choice.|In pain, stressed

INFO_IKENI7_00003528|Please don't make me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003527|I can't, I can't say. Just understand that.|Fighting the hypnotic power he's under

INFO_IKENI7_00003523|Give me what you found.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003522|You don't have to see to know. Let's just do business, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003521|Okay, all right. Look, please, relax.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003520|First, we deal with business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003518|Shards, they'll make your dreams come true. Hah, my days here are numbered.|Sour
INFO_IKENI7_00003517|Because, I didn't get those shards, now I've got to hide in this rat hole.|Sour
INFO_IKENI7_00003516|I'm not going anywhere near that maniac.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003515|You'll have to settle it with him.|Afraid
INFO_IKENI7_00003514|It seems the Scrap Baron has decided he has a score to settle with us. And, by us, I mean both of us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003513|You can read it if you want...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003512|Someone left me a message and in the place I normally stash my contraband. |
INFO_IKENI7_00003511|Oh, I know who the thief is already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003510|I thought this place was safe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003509|Do you see any shards here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003508|Can you see anything that may tell you who took them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003507|Where are my shards?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003505|I've been robbed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003504|No, no, no , no! This can't be true.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003503|No, no, it wouldn't be the Duke. So, which of the other two was it?|Answering his own question.
INFO_IKENI7_00003502|Are we clear?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003501|Are you asking about the price?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003500|I don't care that you lied to me about the scrap delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003499|This is what I mean...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003498|What do you mean?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003497|And, you don't want us to fall out, do you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003496|People can't say I'm not fair with my friends.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003495|But, I'm prepared to call this over.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003494|You didn't tell me the truth about the scrap delivery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003493|There's something else...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003492|Keeping secrets pisses me off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003491|And, since Bill was caught you really should be thankful to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003490|So, I left it to chance whether I would have you, or one of your friends run through with a sword.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003489|But, that wasn't the whole truth, was it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003488|You wanted me to make it seem like everything was okay with the scrap deliveries.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003487|I saw it as adequate punishment for your lie.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003486|That means you chose to use it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003485|He might be stupid enough to use it himself, but there's no way he told you to use it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003484|No - way. No fucking way did he tell you to use that name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003483|You told me William called me 'Mad' Bob.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003481|Your answer wasn't satisfactory.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003480|I asked you to tell me who called me 'Mad' Bob.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003477|What's the situation with Bill?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003476|And, there's Blake. He takes care of things that need taking care of.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003475|Don't ever use that name again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003474|Just so we understand each other, I'll say this one last time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003473|She'd better learn some fucking manners.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003472|Fuck.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003471|I wouldn't put it past her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003469|William? Right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003468|Good, right. Right decision by you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003467|It fucking better be.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003466|It better be.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003465|No, no. Tell me who told you that name then you'd better fucking forget it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003464|Forget that name. |
INFO_IKENI7_00003463|Chloe told me that name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003462|William told me that name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003461|It's forgotten.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003460|Just answer my question.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003459|Was it William? Was it Chloe? Tell me! Was it the Duke?|Angered
INFO_IKENI7_00003458|Just tell me who the fuck used that name.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003457|You haven't heard that name before?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003454|Who called me that? Who the fuck called me that?!|Angered
INFO_IKENI7_00003453|Why do people call you 'Mad' Bob?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003452|You understand what 'get lost' means?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003451|Get lost.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003450|So, do me a favor and piss off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003449|There is nothing for us to discuss, can't you see that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003448|What do you even want?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003447|I am done here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003446|If you have a problem go to the Scrap Baron.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003445|I already said it wasn't my idea.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003444|Listen, asshole.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003443|Give me just one reason why I shouldn't kill you .|
INFO_IKENI7_00003442|I just did my job, that's all.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003441|Tell someone who cares.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003440|I just lost a lot of shards because of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003438|But, when the Scrap Baron tells me to kill a guy, then I kill the guy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003437|Listen, man. I am sorry that I disturbed your little operation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003436|What are you saying?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00003435|Why did you attack Bill?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00003434|Because. And, oh yeah, regards from the Scrap Baron.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003433|Let's go!|
INFO_IKENI7_00003432|I still don't have time to chat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003431|I have news for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003430|Don't take it personally, but find someone else you can annoy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003429|You and me. We're not talking right now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003428|You can wait here, or meet me at my place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003427|Of course. After all, I've seen what happens to partners that betray one another, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003425|But, don't worry, you can trust me. |
INFO_IKENI7_00003422|What? You think I'm suicidal?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003421|You think I'd carry a sum like that around?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003420|Make it quick.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003419|You don't have the shards on you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003418|But, my contact was generous enough to leave a down payment, I'll go and get you some of that now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003417|You're going to have to wait for most of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003416|You got that right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003415|But, you must be waiting on the Elexit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003413|I think these might be what my buyer is interested in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003412|Hmm, yeah. |Examining the blueprints
INFO_IKENI7_00003411|Yes, yes, show me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003410|Want to see what I found in the canyon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003409|But, be careful, those creatures are still going to be up there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003408|You should find his remains there, near a few nests.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003407|Of course. Now, we're partners. There is a large cliff north of the Fort that forms the natural border to Abessa.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003406|I'll get this 'thing' for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003405|But, he killed himself when he stole from me.|Excusing his actions
INFO_IKENI7_00003404|I mean what did he expect? That I'd just let him steal from me? That I'd roll over and take this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003400|You think I enjoyed doing that? Especially as we'd done a few jobs together.|Upset at the implication
INFO_IKENI7_00003399|Do you often shoot people in the back of the head?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003398|Damn things popped up out of nowhere and went straight for the body. There was no way I could get to it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003397|Only the shot startled some creatures.|Recalling the moment - annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00003396|Oh, you don't need to worry about him. I followed his tracks...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003395|So, we find him, we find this thing, is that it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003393|You see? This story only has something for both of us if we trust one another.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003392|Because, I only know of only one buyer who can make this work and he...or she, is only going to trade with me. So, you'd be stuck with something you couldn't sell.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003391|Without my connections, you'd have jack shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003390|Well, I still wouldn't be worse off would I? I would have what I want and you, well...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003389|Is there a reason I shouldn't? Are you the sort that would run off with the loot?|Growing suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00003388|Why are you trusting me with this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003387|No joke. I have the connections to make this happen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003386|Thousands, maybe tens of thousands of shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003385|How much Elexit are we talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003384|You bring back what you find on him and I'll get you enough Elexit so you're set for life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003382|But, you, you've got everything you need to get in there and loot the body.|Observing the player
INFO_IKENI7_00003381|Shooting a bunch of creatures? I'm not a good enough shot for that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003380|I was always the brains of the bunch, he was the brawn. Shooting one guy who is sitting still, that's one thing. |
INFO_IKENI7_00003379|So, why haven't you gone back?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003378|I was out of ammo, that was my last shot. |
INFO_IKENI7_00003377|So, why didn't you kill them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003376|One well aimed shot to the back of his head and...problem taken care of.|Recalling the moment
INFO_IKENI7_00003375|Stuck a gun in my face and took it. Idiot didn't even know what he had in his hand.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003373|I mean, I had it. I had it in right my hand! But, then this asshole partner of mine took it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003372|As you've probably figured out, I've got a lead, but I've not got the thing I need. We need.|Quickly correcting himself.
INFO_IKENI7_00003371|And, that's good, because I need help with this thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003370|You're going to want a part of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003369|I mean, once you hear what I have to say, well...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003368|No, no, that's okay. if you really want to listen then maybe you're all right.|Forgiving him
INFO_IKENI7_00003367|Sure, then I'll just go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003366|Are you going to waste my time, or do you really want to know?|Wary, annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00003365|What was it you wanted to talk to me about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003364|Are you kidding? Imagine what people would pay for this power!?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003363|How does this earn me thousands of shards?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003362|But, fair enough, if you don't want to believe me, you'll miss out.|Salesmanlike
INFO_IKENI7_00003361|Don't you get it? This is Old World stuff. Back when there were countries and space travel. They could do practically anything back then.|Protesting
INFO_IKENI7_00003360|Sounds like bullshit to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003358|And, this knowledge, it is so dangerous it can turn entire regions to desert, or provide them with all the energy they could ever dream of. For real.|Amazed at his find
INFO_IKENI7_00003357|And, I came across some knowledge from the Old World.|Building the tension
INFO_IKENI7_00003356|I was looking around in a few ruins for the usual kind of stuff. You know? Just the usual.|Telling a story
INFO_IKENI7_00003352|Right, yeah, of course! The thing is, I recently returned from an expedition out into the wastelands.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003351|I know, I know, it sounds too good to be true, but listen and then you can decide, yeah?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003350|You listen to me and I'll tell you how close those shards are to being in your reach.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003349|Don't be so hasty there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003348|Heh, I knew you would bite! That's a lot of shards for anyone, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003347|There's no way you have that much Elexit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003346|Okay, tell me the details.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003345|You think? And does that mean you wouldn't interested in a few thousand shards?|A few thousand is a lot of money.
INFO_IKENI7_00003344|I mean why would anyone want to be here if it wasn't for profit? So, let me ask you, are you interested in earning a few shards?|Salesmanlike
INFO_IKENI7_00003343|All right, but make it quick.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003342|Sounds like a con.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003341|You're not involved with any of the mob here are you? So, I'm thinking that you might be the right person.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003339|No. And, that's exactly why I want to talk to you. I need someone with 'independent interests'.|Thinking of how to describe what he needs.
INFO_IKENI7_00003338|Well, I've got to tell you, I think my days of being stuck in this rat hole might soon be over.|Salesmanlike, positive
INFO_IKENI7_00003336|Do we know each other?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003335|Hey, you! Yeah, you! Do you have a second?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003334|Take this in the name of Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003333|Good, good, then we can continue with the mission.|Relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00003332|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003331|Did you convince him he doesn't have to worry about his shipment?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003330|I spoke to the Scrap Baron.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003329|Here, this is your share for helping me out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003328|Did those fuckers pay you for their lives?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003327|You had your orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003326|You're getting your scrap, isn't that enough?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003325|Why?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003323|The Clerics are still alive?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003322|I shouldn't have given you a first one...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003320|You do anything else for me, you'd better play it straight and you'd better not fuck up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003319|But, you can remember my generosity.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003318|You tried to cheat me and you want payment? No chance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003317|My profit. Any profit belongs to me, asshole.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003316|You can tell them you fooled me and take their shards.|Coming to a conclusion
INFO_IKENI7_00003314|Maybe, I can find a way to use them to my advantage...|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00003313|These Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003312|Give me a second chance to prove myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003311|Scrap is profit. Isn't that what you believe? |
INFO_IKENI7_00003309|Right. Good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003308|Is that what you're trying to do? Play me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003307|Split the scrap, take the profits?|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00003306|Me and the Clerics...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003305|I want to know if you're playing both sides.|Assessing the player
INFO_IKENI7_00003304|Do you want me to figure it out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003303|If there's a problem with Clerics then how the fuck am I going to get my scrap?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003302|Clerics?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003301|The scrap collectors have a problem with some Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003300|Nothing else.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003299|Anything else to tell me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003298|Take these shards as a down payment for your services.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003297|I want you to go and find out if he knows anything. If he does we will have to consider our next move.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003296|And, what can you tell me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003295|I've been to the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003294|Calaan is right, greed will be our undoing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003293|Maybe, you haven't been careful enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003292|What do you mean?|Concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00003290|The Outlaws call him Mad Bob.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003288|He trades salvaged scrap.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003287|The only person who might be calls himself the Scrap Baron.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003286|The Outlaws don't keep secrets.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003285|You think someone in the Fort is interested in these ruins?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003284|My mission must come first.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003283|Then, I'm sorry.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003282|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003281|Is that your final word?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003280|If you're caught, the Outlaws don't tend to be subtle when they're angry.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003279|Good, but be careful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003277|You need to sell that lie, make it sound like everything is getting back to normal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003276|Just enough so that suspicion is decreased.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003275|I will make sure that the Outlaws get their deliveries from time to time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003274|Forget it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003273|Can I count on your assistance?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003272|You can count on me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003271|So, don't put either of us in a position we don't want to be in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003270|Anyone.|Stressing this as a warning
INFO_IKENI7_00003269|And, I have the authority to kill anyone who endangers this mission.|Warning
INFO_IKENI7_00003268|Those are my orders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003267|I don't expect you to understand, but as I got things wrong, so I must fix them. The mission must be successful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003266|I got things wrong, so now I'll fix them. The mission must be successful.|Determined
INFO_IKENI7_00003264|What can I do?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003263|It's too late for that. You've made your mistake, you should leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003262|So, I think finding a way to throw off his suspicions would be our best course.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003260|An open fight could mean losses in men and material.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003259|I will have to rethink our strategy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003258|So, what's your plan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003257|Damn, I feared stopping them completely was pushing our luck. |
INFO_IKENI7_00003256|The Scrap Baron has noticed that his deliveries have stopped.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003255|We Clerics took a solemn oath to work together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003253|Well, even if you don't know how to appreciate Calaans's gift, I am not your emeny.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003252|I see, sounds like we have a common problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003251|I'm no Outlaw.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003250|Remember, my hospitality when you come to make your choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003249|All Clerics offer a hand to all Free People.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003248|I'm not part of any Faction.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003247|I'm planning to join up with the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003246|I'm a Cleric like you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003245|Now, tell me, are you a son of Tavar? Did you swear allegiance to the Duke and his Outlaws?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003243|And, any future Outlaw will need profits to make their way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003242|And, you won't care about loyalty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003240|Because, if you are an Outlaw, then you will understand profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003239|Calaan expects it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003238|Because, I expect it of you. |
INFO_IKENI7_00003237|Calaan will see that you are well rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003236|All you'll need to do is talk to a few people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003235|And, you won't be seen as a threat if you go to the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003233|Because, I can help you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003232|Why should I help you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003231|But, I suppose I could use your help to learn if the Duke and his men know of our presence.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003230|We've been careful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003229|You're not worried about the Duke finding out where you are?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003228|The Duke relies on profits to keep power. We cut off his profits and there's a chance his men will overthrow him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003227|And, we also deny them to the enemy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003226|We acquire the resources we need.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003225|Here we achieve two things at once.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003224|Why here of all places? It's a long way from Ignadon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003222|And, we can get those resources right here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003221|We need a lot of raw materials to feed our smelting furnaces in Ignadon. Material that is essential for our fighting machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003220|No? Well, Calaan works in mysterious ways. He brought you here, brother.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003219|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003218|Weren't you sent here from the Hort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003217|What is your job here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003216|I hope one day you will come to serve Calaan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003214|Then you can stay here as my guest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003212|Choose as you may, but don't try and steal anything while you're here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003211|Why choose that? You'll get no loyalty. You'll be counting your breaths as much as you count your shards, for if you run out of one, you run out of the other in Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003210|You're free to rest and relax here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003209|Then Calaan bring you peace.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003208|May Calaan bless you..|
INFO_IKENI7_00003207|I had to send the scrap supplies to them. And I had to keep that quiet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003206|I have no idea how they did that, but the pressure in my head was like being swept away.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003205|I had to do what they wanted and I couldn't say a thing, just...do what they asked me to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003204|The Clerics that came by here suggested... they ...well, used their power on my mind.|Struggling to put his words in place, still finding resistance there.
INFO_IKENI7_00003203|So, you're free now? So, you can tell me what happened to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003202|So asking that isn't going to get me anywhere?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003201|Anything! There's something in my mind. He gets what he wants. |
INFO_IKENI7_00003200|What can't you say?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003199|I'm not hiding anything. I just...can't say.|Nervous, upset
INFO_IKENI7_00003198|You're hiding something from me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003196|Well, you don't have to fight now, all you have to do is hand over everything you have.|Threatening him.
INFO_IKENI7_00003195|I work like crazy, but at the end of the day I get nothing in return. How's that for life experience?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003194|After all that, my mind is free? I guess that's good news, even if the good news means dealing with Mad Bob being pissed at me.|Testing, thinking
INFO_IKENI7_00003193|So, I'm free of him? Really free?|Relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00003192|You mean the Clerics, on the island? They won't give you any more trouble. This Lord of the Island won't get into your head again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003191|But, the Lord of the Island, he...he...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003190|That's all I can say. I can't...I can't tell you anymore.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003189|Vol...Vol. He's a Cl...a Cl....He's the lord of the island. He's on the island.|Trying to say Volkmar, then trying Cleric, but is stopped he finds another description that he can use
INFO_IKENI7_00003188|And, who is the new boss?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003187|No. No, I know he won't. I know he'll want me dead, but. I told you, all scrap has to go to the new boss. I told you I don't have a choice.|Emotional, trapped
INFO_IKENI7_00003185|The Scrap Baron wants that scrap delivered.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003184|Here. Take it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003183|This isn't the first time I've been robbed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003182|Put your weapons away. I know how it goes.|Resigned
INFO_IKENI7_00003181|The new boss wants all the scrap on pain of death. And he's in my mind. Controls what I think. He owns me and everything I find. He....|The pain growing in his head until he can't talk
INFO_IKENI7_00003180|H-H- I can't say. I can't give you anything either. If I do, I'm dead, you're dead.|Fighting the hypnotic power he's under
INFO_IKENI7_00003179|Who's this boss? What have you given your word about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003178|I can't!! The new boss forbids it. I...I just can't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003177|Otherwise, I'd just starve out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003176|I suppose I should just be happy I'm still alive and that there's normally something left for me in these ruins.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003175|It doesn't seem to mean anything that I collect more from the ruins than the other collectors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003174|To make it worse it's mostly from Outlaws, my own people. Everyone else on Magalan is scared of Albs, I'm watching my neighbors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003173|Welcome to Tavar. Trouble here every day.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003172|Sounds like you're having trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003171|I don't see any special protection.|Threatening him.
INFO_IKENI7_00003170|No, no, I don't want to fight. Just relax, okay? I'm under special protection all right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003169|Every last bastard piece you find. You have to fight for it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003168|Collecting? You don't collect it out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003166|Are you collecting scrap?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003165|Our new boss, he's...he's one of your people. You should have had the deliveries as requested.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003164|Who is 'he'?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003163|Oh, oh, I'm sorry sir, I...I didn't realize that 'he' had sent you. Please, please tell, 'him' that everything is going as 'he' requires.|Sudden realisation as a result of Volkmar's suggestion. Hitting 'him' and 'he'
INFO_IKENI7_00003161|Normally, the ruins only attract reavers.|Nervously assessing the player character
INFO_IKENI7_00003160|You don't look like a reaver|Nervously assessing the player character
INFO_IKENI7_00003159|But, if you were a reaver, I'd have a bullet in the head already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003158|Are you a Berserker? What are you doing here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003152|You're not a reaver.|Nervously assessing the player character
INFO_IKENI7_00003151|Are you going to do this job, or not? If your useless ass can't handle it then I might as well get someone else. Do the job.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003150|That's not a lot of help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003149|Just get out to that island and look around.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003148|Then you'll have to take care of this on your own.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003147|Ethan's dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003146|You'll find him out amongst the sea of debris in front of the island. Least that's where he said he was going.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003142|I mean a proper flow, right down his leg and into the sand until there's a big damp patch. A man with a bladder like that, is a man you can trust.|Deciding to help
INFO_IKENI7_00003141|Ethan. He's normally pretty reliable. He knows shards count and he pisses himself every time I remind him what happened to his predecessor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003140|Who's in charge of these missing scrap deliveries?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003138|It seems you weren't able to find the stolen Elex for Caldrim.|Disappointed.
INFO_IKENI7_00003137|But, I'm not telling you anything new. You know life beyond the walls, probably better than I do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003136|Dead, rotting and out of my business.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003135|Leave? I want those motherfuckers dead!|
INFO_IKENI7_00003134|They're on the island and they've hijacked your scrap deliveries. Do you want them to leave?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003133|What are those motherfuckers doing wrapped up in my business?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003132|Clerics?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00003131|You're not getting your scrap deliveries because of a group of Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003130|You'd better not be eating into my profits.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003127|Fuck the details, bring me the profits.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003126|Do you want the details?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003125|You got it done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003124|Right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003122|You'd better be right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003121|Your scrap will be delivered soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003120|So, I want you to go and find out what's happening and make damn sure my scrap arrives soon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003119|And, yet so far...no scrap deliveries.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003118|I sent some scrap collectors out to scavenge a set of ruins on an island to the south.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003116|Everything I'd heard about those ruins screamed profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003114|Well, first, I want some answers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003107|Where do you want me to start?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003106|About these favors you want...|
INFO_IKENI7_00003102|And, if they don't get the scrap their blood trickles down into the desert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003100|Whatever any one says, my scrap is the savior of this shithouse.|Proud
INFO_IKENI7_00003099|I get the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003097|Goes to show, there's an audience for every joke, if you can find them. Fucker. I loved that dog.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003096|Laughed himself stupid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003095|Then he put a bullet in my dog.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003094|I remember one time when I took the piss out of him he told me 'if something annoys you, get rid of it'.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003093|You know, my dad loved jokes.|Recollection
INFO_IKENI7_00003092|Play it calm don't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003091|Sure, that'd be great.|Cool

INFO_IKENI7_00003088|Hey.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003087|I've got the shards. You just have to do me a few favors to get them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003082|You can work for me.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003080|It's always about shards.|He knew this was coming
INFO_IKENI7_00003079|Now, you come to it!|Finally to business!
INFO_IKENI7_00003078|So, enjoy your freedom. People died to get it for you.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003073|Do you have work for me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003072|And, then you take the profits?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003070|You just need the people to get it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003069|It's out there, waiting to be found. Treasure amongst the sands.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003067|Where do you get this scrap?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003066|Or, steal from me. Or, keep asking me dumbass questions. |
INFO_IKENI7_00003065|And, as long as you don't piss me off.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003055|What do you do with all this scrap?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003054|While you can still breathe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003051|All that scrap, all that rust. That's freedom. Look at it, breathe it deep.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003047|Oh! And the comedy keeps coming!|
INFO_IKENI7_00003046|Bring me scrap, or you're worthless to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003045|Scrap is worth more than life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003044|Life is cheap, people are cheap.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003043|Scrap is profit.|Explaining the reality

INFO_IKENI7_00003040|The Scrap Baron? Well, that explains why you're living in this dump.|

INFO_IKENI7_00003007|No offense, I'm just looking around.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003006|I saw it back there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003005|So, I am asking myself where you saw the fucking sign that says 'hey, talk to this guy'?|Narrating himself
INFO_IKENI7_00003003|Do I know you? You see, I'm thinking 'no I don't know you'.|Narrating himself
INFO_IKENI7_00003002|But, it's their fault, they shouldn't have broken the Law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00003001|Now, nobody is keeping record of how many have died, or how many are still working where they were told to. So, who knows?|
INFO_IKENI7_00003000|Not since the recent Alb attacks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002999|I don't know. There used to be guards that went down there to check on them, but they don't do that anymore.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002998|How many exiled live in the Valley?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002997|I am certain we will have more exiles to send to, or recall from the Valley in the coming weeks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002996|Good. Then if that is all that needs to be done, I will arrange for that to happen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002995|If the gear is reinstalled it should work again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002994|So, the lift is out of operation?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002993|If you want the lift into the Valley to work, it will need this gear reinstalling.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002992|That post is as good as cursed, the number of men that have been lost to it.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00002991|You can use the elevator. It should be working again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002990|Right, workers are already on their way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002988|Hold on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002987|He is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002986|I sent Sten there just a few days ago.|Surprised
INFO_IKENI7_00002985|The lift into the Valley of the Damned needs a new guard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002984|But, if I find out that someone has used this elevator without authorization, you will have to answer to me..|Blustering, getting his face back.
INFO_IKENI7_00002982|So. That's it. The elevator should work now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002981|Give me a minute.|##going to fix the lift?
INFO_IKENI7_00002980|Right, right, I will get to work right away.|Grudging, reluctant
INFO_IKENI7_00002979|I'll deal with that when I need to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002977|So, I'm going to shut it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002976|Not if I shut your mouth first.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002975|Good. Great. No need to say a thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002974|I won't tell Ragnar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002973|I'm going to do what I want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002972|Look, you've got what you want, don't push me. You don't need to go telling anyone anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002971|You know other people will come here?|Pointing out the obvious
INFO_IKENI7_00002970|I'm not promising you anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002969|Ragnar can't find out that I sabotaged his elevator. All right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002968|Give me your word, man to man, that you will keep your silence.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002967|I will, under one condition.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002966|So, your mind can't be changed? All right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002965|I don't want it found.|Spikey
INFO_IKENI7_00002964|I'll find the missing gear.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002963|I'm not asking, fix the damn winch!|
INFO_IKENI7_00002962|We could be attacked, murdered, passed over for promotion, who knows what could happen.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002961|Are you sure you want that doing? Think about it. You're opening the door to criminals.|One last attempt to persuade the player.
INFO_IKENI7_00002960|I've got the missing gear. So, now you can repair the winch.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002959|Besides, most of them down there are too busy dodging the creatures to plan an escape.|Pleased that the exiled have problems.
INFO_IKENI7_00002958|I do guarding and repairing remember?|Stressing 'and'
INFO_IKENI7_00002956|Not this way they don't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002955|And, our Warlords are smart. Really smart. They can see when someone is a threat to Goliet. That's why my job is important.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002954|You have to be an idiot to break it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002953|The Law is clear.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002952|Does anyone ever escape?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002951|Does anyone ever get exiled unjustly?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002949|Damned, yeah?|Pointing out the obvious
INFO_IKENI7_00002948|I don't ever want to see that place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002947|That place is for the exiled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002946|Have you ever been in the Valley of the Damned yourself?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002945|Say, don't you have something else to do with your time? |
INFO_IKENI7_00002944|So, you dropped it somewhere?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002943|You won't find anything up here, that's for sure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002942|Let me think. No, no, no, sorry. I don't have a clue where it is.|Play acting
INFO_IKENI7_00002941|Can you help me find the gear?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002940|Shit. I knew soon as I saw you I knew that this day was going to be a ball ache.|Grumbling
INFO_IKENI7_00002939|So, it's by the waterfall? Thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002938|With any luck no one will find it.|Snarky, not meaning it.
INFO_IKENI7_00002937|Yeah, good luck with that, I dropped down the waterfall.|Reluctant.
INFO_IKENI7_00002936|You're going to tell me how I can get the gear back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002935|Fuck that. Fuck them. They got themselves sent down there, they can stay down there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002933|Do you think it's right that they, those criminals get to go home for good service? While good people like me get stuck here without a chance for parole?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002932|I don't want anyone to leave the Valley. And be honest, neither do you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002931|You wanted to sabotage it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002930|I took the winch apart and got rid of the gear. Satisfied?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002929|You know what? Fuck it.|Deciding to confess
INFO_IKENI7_00002928|But, aren't you the person responsible for maintenance?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002927|So...you weren't guarding the elevator and now you're not repairing it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002926|Clever, yeah, very clever. Look the part's gone and that's it. Now, I'm back at my post and, you know, maybe someone took the gear for maintenance, or something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002925|You won't get to use the elevator until you've told me your business.|Self-important
INFO_IKENI7_00002924|It could be that I left my post for a short while.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002923|I've heard enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002922|Even though you are supposed to be guarding the elevator?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002921|Exactly.|Lying
INFO_IKENI7_00002920|It was stolen?|Guessing
INFO_IKENI7_00002919|It's gone. And that's it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002918|Since the other night. But, why do you care?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002917|How long has the gear been missing?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002916|It's your job, why don't you go and fetch a spare part?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002915|Spare part? Spare part? Now, why didn't I think of that? Wait, yeah, I've got loads of parts for you, right here. . In my pants.|Pretending to think
INFO_IKENI7_00002914|If I go off looking for things, then I wouldn't be doing either part of my job. And, I don't want to get exiled for dereliction of duty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002913|Because, my job has two parts, right? Guarding and repairing. Right now, there's only one part of my job that I'm not doing.|Stressing 'and'
INFO_IKENI7_00002912|Have you got a spare part?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002911|Yeah?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002910|That depends.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002908|It's a water winch. It needs water. And gears. It's complicated stuff.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002907|So, unless you've got a portable smelter and forge to make a new one, you're not going to be repairing it right now, are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002906|Fixing this elevator is really complicated seeing as one of the gears is missing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002905|Yeah. And?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002904|I thought you said it was your job to repair the lift?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002903|It's just traitors and failures down there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002902|Well, that's saved you from yourself. No sane person enters the Valley willingly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002901|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002900|It's a winch. Rope, wheel, up and down. What's so complicated about that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002899|What makes you think that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002898|Enough to know it can't be complicated to fix.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002897|The elevator is bust and no one's showed me how to fix it. So, unless you know anything about winches, you can't get down there. Do you know anything about winches?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002896|You watch your mouth. I'm the sole sentinel here. I do the guarding and the repairing.|Self-important
INFO_IKENI7_00002895|What do you do here, apart from shout at passersby?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002893|More of the guarding than repairing right now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002892|What elevator? The enormous wheel over there. The winch down to the world of exile.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002891|What elevator?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002888|Come on, speak up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002887|Are you on your way down to join the damned, or have you just come to see where all the 'bad people' go?|With a sneer
INFO_IKENI7_00002886|So, what have we here? An exile, or sightseer?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002885|Do you know how I've survived out here with all those threats?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002884|Just leave me be!|If the player threatened Korin and Korin ran.
INFO_IKENI7_00002883|Now, I can fight back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002882|Now, I stand a chance. Guess, I'd better take better care of it in future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002881|Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002880|It's in the pit by the Converter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002879|Thank you, thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002878|I will find your club.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002877|Here is your club.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002876|Please? My life could be in your hands.|Pleading
INFO_IKENI7_00002875|It would be no extra risk for you, but it could save my life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002874|I'm only asking you to look out for it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002873|Oh, great. You don't know how much of a relief that is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002872|If you have already decided to go in there, then bringing that back would give me more of a chance.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002871|You're here for your own reasons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002870|I already have your club.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002869|Why should I put myself in danger for you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002868|You want it, you get it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002867|By not standing still.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002865|Mutants, Outlaws, Albs...|
INFO_IKENI7_00002864|Could you look for it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002863|Say...If you're going in there ...|
INFO_IKENI7_00002862|If I'd climbed down to get it they would have cut me off and killed me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002859|I did, I had a club, but I lost it the second time I went in there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002858|Why didn't you bring a weapon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002857|Mutants got through the defenses. All were killed, but me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002856|But, when I was sent to the Seedling fields to recover...|
INFO_IKENI7_00002853|Once again, I can't complete the task I was given. So, I can't go back. With all this failure exile to the Valley of the Damned must follow.|Sorry for himself
INFO_IKENI7_00002852|Here, for your trouble.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002851|And yet you share what you have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002850|Thank you. I wasn't sure if you'd understand what we were doing here. If you'd help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002849|I have some healing potions here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002848|That will help the people here and give us a couple spare in case of further attacks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002847|Five small healing potions should be enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002846|I'll get you some potions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002845|Could you get us those supplies?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002844|If we're to stay and complete our mission that is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002843|We need to heal ourselves as well as the World Heart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002842|We could do with some healing potions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002841|Is there anything you need?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002833|So, take these shards. That's the payment you're getting from the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002832|The Duke owns everything in Tavar. You are getting what is owed to you.|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00002831|I just want what is owed to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002830|Are you trying to take shards from him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002829|Those shards belong to the Duke.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002828|Here friend - profit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002827|Good. You know when to call a deal done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002826|Deal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002825|I want all of what was promised to Max.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002824|So, here's what I'll do. Seeing as you came here, I'll pay you half what Max would've got. The rest will cover his death expenses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002823|Yes, I can see thoughts of profit in people's minds.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00002822|And, to collect what I said I would pay Max?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002821|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002820|And, you came here to tell me that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002819|The Berserkers are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002818|What about the Berserkers? How many men am I going to need to send to get rid of them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002817|Max is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002816|So, relax, it's Max. It will get taken care of.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002815|I still need to talk to William.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002814|But, you'd better know you've got me pissed!|
INFO_IKENI7_00002813|This isn't to do with...you know what? Take some damn shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002812|If you thought you could fight, you wouldn't be talking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002811|Why should I be afraid of you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002810|Why would I do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002809|Fuck it. Half. Okay? Take it, but don't come back for more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002808|Give me half what you have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002807|Give me everything you have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002806|But...but I tell you what, I'll share the few I was given, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002805|See this ground here? You might as well shout at that and see if it gives you shards. I wasn't given my proper share.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002804|Give me my shards now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002803|Hey, do you think I have a magic pouch of shards? I've paid you already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002801|You hanging around is not going to help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002800|So, do yourself a favor and piss off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002799|But, I have a lot of friends here in the Fort, so if you go for my throat, you might find yourself with a lot of new enemies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002798|You can pick me up, turn me upside down and shake me if you like.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002797|How long do you need to get the shards?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002796|I really don't have a single shard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002795|Why would I mess with you? |
INFO_IKENI7_00002794|Pay the shards, or I will take the shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002792|I didn't get paid, so you don't. That is life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002791|I might be the man, but I can't pull shards out of my ass.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002790|You said 'you-were-the-man', so pay up.|Playing on Max's catch phrase.
INFO_IKENI7_00002789|That's the truth! What did you want me to do, pick a fight with the Duke's chosen man?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002788|You expect me to believe that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002787|Well, I warned you. William was pissed and didn't pay, so...no shards for me, no shards for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002786|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002785|The Berserkers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002784|Owed, for what?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002783|Come back in a few hours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002782|I told you I'll take care of it. But, you need to give me the time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002781|Take it easy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002779|The shards for helping take care of the Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002778|Give me what I'm owed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002768|You got half the job done, be glad you're getting anything. Now piss off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002767|I got the job done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002766|Max, take your bullshit somewhere else. You know the deal. Take it up with the Duke if you have a problem with it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002765|I took care of the problem, your main problem and you think this pittance is worth it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002763|And, where are the hostages? You know hostages are shards, so where are they?|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00002762|Where are the rest of the men? You can't tell me things went smoothly if they're all dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002761|You were only going to get a cut if everything went smoothly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002760|Yeah, so...time to talk my reward.|Swagger
INFO_IKENI7_00002759|Good. The Duke will be pleased to hear that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002758|The World Hearts were dealt with.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002757|And, the Berserkers' 'magic trees'?|Disdainful reference to the Berserkers' 'World Hearts'
INFO_IKENI7_00002756|The Berserkers you want sorted, they are sorted. I told you I-am-the-man.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002755|So, stay here and shut the fuck up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002754|You're going to be pissed when you don't get anything, I'm going to be pissed if you start reducing my reward too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002753|We're here. Just do us both a favor and keep your mouth shut.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002752|Meet me tomorrow in the bar. That will give me time to scrape the shards together, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002750|Okay, okay. But, don't go complaining when that leaves you with nothing.|Grumbling, unhappy
INFO_IKENI7_00002749|No. I am coming with you.|Insistent
INFO_IKENI7_00002748|When will you pay me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002747|So, you head off and I'll find you later. Right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002746|But, that's my generosity and my name that will do that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002745|And, Max will look after you. I'll get you a few shards, okay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002744|My orders, my plan, my reward. You can find your own path to shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002743|What share?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002742|No, no, no. 'I'-am-the-man. That's the saying, not 'We-are-the-men'. I don't need company. You go get yourself a drink.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002741|I'll come with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002740|What about my share?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002739|I know I will as soon as I get my reward. |
INFO_IKENI7_00002738|More than make it, you'll find a life worth living.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002737|Keep your mouth and your pockets shut and you'll make it here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002736|So, here we are. Welcome to the largest pile of Old World scrap on Magalan!|
INFO_IKENI7_00002734|See, even the Albs have their uses.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002733|Hands clean, problem gone, issue over and done with. All thanks to Xacor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002730|But, if there's someone you really need to get rid of, you can throw them in there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002729|Is that so?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002728|That's one stupid way to get killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002727|Take my advice, don't go near the Converter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002726|That was useful advice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002725|A threat? Why would I threaten you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002724|Was that a threat?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002723|People will think you have a secret and secrets are worth shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002722|You'd do better to make something up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002721|No one's from nowhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002720|Nowhere.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002719|Where are you from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002718|Let's go and collect the fat reward!|
INFO_IKENI7_00002717|Listen, can you hear that? That's the Entertainment District calling us!|
INFO_IKENI7_00002716|Oh, and don't piss off the Duke. Or, you won't be enjoying anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002715|Oh, then you are in for a time! All this out here, that's just to pay for what's in there! You make sure you go to the Entertainment District.|Enthusing
INFO_IKENI7_00002714|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002713|If you need a reason to go out into the desert and to come back, that's what it is, am I right?!|
INFO_IKENI7_00002712|Oh, then you know the Entertainment District...you've been there, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002711|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002710|But, say, have you ever even been to the Fort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002709|This is the life. This-is-the-life!|
INFO_IKENI7_00002708|Aw, I can almost touch those chems from here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002707|We just need to go a little further.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002706|All right, we're still alive. We're still alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002704|Are we just going to stand here, or are we going to the Fort?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002703|Stay alert. There are things out here just waiting for you to run right into their teeth.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002702|You're right, we should move fast.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002701|Let's get going.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002700|So, keep your eyes open, Let's not get shot, eaten, or messed up by anything on the way home.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002699|There are plenty of ambush spots out there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002698|Shards attract trouble and I want to get home in a state where I can spend them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002697|We've made some good distance, but the hard bit comes next.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002696|Follow me and we'll head back now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002695|We're going to start taking what's ours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002694|We're not just going to sit in the desert with him in charge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002693|And, now the Duke, hah, I think the other factions are in for a surprise.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002692|People have been running out here into the desert ever since the Territory Wars.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002691|They've always been out here. I mean if you've got a price on your head, where else are you going to run?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002690|Why did the Outlaws set up home out here in Tavar?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002689|It's not like any of my team can do that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002688|Good. I can use someone to watch my back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002687|I'll come with you to the Fort.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002686|Take what ever you want from their bodies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002685|And, you can be sure as the last survivor to return and make a report I will be asking William for a bonus.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002684|Are you kidding?! That Elexit plus the Duke knowing 'I-am-the-man!'? Oh, that's worth a lot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002683|Is that enough?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002682|A couple of thousand shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002681|What did the Duke promise you for getting rid of the Berserkers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002680|This is war! This is a battle to the last! You have to use every trick. And, I get to take his share too.|Declaration, then the end as an amused aside.
INFO_IKENI7_00002679|Another problem that must find its own solution...|
INFO_IKENI7_00002678|And the dead will tell no tales.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002677|I don't know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002676|Or, did you hear about it from your friends?|Bitter, then change of tone to link into the next line.
INFO_IKENI7_00002675|This should at least cover the supplies it took to bring me this information.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002674|Here, you have earned this as payment for your news.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002673|If we can hold that part of Tavar, then in only a few years that desert will be forest and Edan will stretch yet further across Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002672|I will send him reinforcements.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002671|He has done well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002670|Garald has managed to hold the Outlaws off, for now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002667|Blood and profit are the only things these Outlaws understand.|Angered
INFO_IKENI7_00002666|Then the Duke must pay for this in blood.|Angered
INFO_IKENI7_00002665|All dead. None survived.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002664|And our men?|Worried
INFO_IKENI7_00002663|It was destroyed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002662|Speak up now, has the World Heart survived?|Concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00002661|You've seen this for yourself?|Concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00002660|Your outpost in Tavar was attacked by Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002659|Between the sand and the wildlife, Tavar has a short memory.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002658|We'll leave them for the desert to clean up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002657|What about your comrades?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002656|Why would I want to hang out in this scrap of desert?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002655|I'm going back to the Fort to get my share.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002654|When I can be back there with a cold beer, warm women and the Duke telling me that 'I-am-the-man!'?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002653|Fuck off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002652|Are you setting up camp here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002651|Believe me, the Duke already has plans in the works to get rid of their Converter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002650|Them too, no one is taking what we own. No one's taking our freedom.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002649|But, what about the Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002648|Fuck their trees. We own this desert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002646|Those bastards are trying to take what's ours. This is the Duke's land.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002645|Why attack these Berserkers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002644|Sure, I pumped them full of chems beforehand. He thought he'd survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002643|And, he did it?|Surprised
INFO_IKENI7_00002642|Yeah. I told one of my guys to put a grenade in his mouth, pull the pin and jump on a Berserker.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002641|Grenade trick?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002640|Luckily, my little grenade trick worked.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002639|It wasn't easy. Those Berserkers can handle themselves.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002638|You got the job done here.|Neutral
INFO_IKENI7_00002637|I guess you won't be joining them now, will you?|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00002636|Normally, you Clerics can't wait to try and blow my head off.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002635|I'm surprised you helped us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002634|The Duke gave me this job. So, I will take the payment.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002633|But, the takings from this fight are mine, right?|Statement, rhetorical question.
INFO_IKENI7_00002632|They might as well live in the stone age...|
INFO_IKENI7_00002631|What are you doing with those throwbacks?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002630|Those bastard Berserkers got what they deserved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002629|I...am the man.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002628|It seems these Outlaws might have some courage after all.|Stressed
INFO_IKENI7_00002627|Until then, I have to prevent more Outlaw attacks. |
INFO_IKENI7_00002626|With the right equipment, our Cultivators will heal the World Heart and we'll see change here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002625|The Outlaws don't believe in anything, why should they believe in keeping this land?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002624|So, you're planning to stay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002622|But, we have a mission here and it is under threat. Without new men, everything we have started here will turn back to desert..|
INFO_IKENI7_00002621|Then tell him what you've seen here. The eyes in Goliet are turned to the Albs, or to the Clerics and with good reason.|Understanding, but annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00002620|Ragnar is waiting for a report.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002619|And, soon this land will be changed. From empty desert there comes new life. And, those bastards will find their land transformed to paradise. If they don't kill us first.|Aware of the irony
INFO_IKENI7_00002618|For the World Heart. This is where the Warlords told us to plant it, so here we are. Those bastard Outlaws have damaged it a few times, but it's growing back. |
INFO_IKENI7_00002617|Why did you make camp here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002616|But, once more they have taken on more than they can handle. And so, my duty has been done.|Victorious
INFO_IKENI7_00002615|This is our camp, we're here to grow the World Heart, in between being attacked by the Duke's men.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002614|And, speak straight, I don't have time for lies, or talk of Calaan.|Hostile
INFO_IKENI7_00002613|What are you doing here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002612|Come back later.|Stressed
INFO_IKENI7_00002611|What do you want here, Cleric?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002610|What do you want here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002608|All they need to do is leave us alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002607|It's a good thing Goliet sent you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002606|So, what about you? do you want to be next? Are all Outlaws the same?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002604|Brave, but stupid. Why did he even attack us? Orders? For Elexit? Do they even know what they're doing out here?|Following combat - frustrated.
INFO_IKENI7_00002603|Oh? What is it?|Concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00002602|I have news from the other regions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002600|You'll find the World Heart in Abessa to the south of the Domed City.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002599|You will have to walk carefully once you're there. The Outlaws do not take kindly to people crossing through their lands.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002598|The World Heart in Tavar was sent to an oasis out in the desert.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002597|Where are the World Hearts?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002595|You ensure you're properly equipped before you go. It isn't a short journey and the way will be difficult.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002594|It is time that we learned their fates.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002593|Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002592|I will look for your men in Tavar and Abessa.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002591|While the Outlaws see only profit and pleasure today with no interest in tomorrow. And so, we come into conflict and the world burns when it could heal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002590|But, for the Albs, Elex comes before anything. The Clerics worship their God and their machines and do not trust nature.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002589|You came to us from beyond our walls, if you know your way across these lands, could you go to the World Hearts and see what happened to our men?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002588|And they have been attacked almost constantly. In fact their reports are overdue.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002587|Spoken, no. But, we sent men to establish World Hearts in Abessa and Tavar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002586|Do you know that for sure? Have you spoken to the other factions?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002585|They fear the changes we bring.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002584|But, the other factions don't see it that way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002583|The Berserkers believe that all of Magalan should be healed, not just Edan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002582|If we can plant more World Hearts in Tavar, or Abessa, then we could give all the soil there new life too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002581|Hah, that's a question we all ask! How could healing the planet not aid us all?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002580|So, you have no interests outside Edan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002579|Why are the factions fighting?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002578|But, the peace that has strained since our last war has never held easy. The Outlaws, well, they have no true leader and no true cause. Any dealings with them are dealings with individuals.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002576|The Albs want no contact, but that of war and conflict. Perhaps, the Separatists will be more open to conversation, but trust will be hard. We have maintained conversations with the Clerics.|Explaining the diplomatic situation.
INFO_IKENI7_00002575|What contact do the Berserkers have with the other factions?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002548|Before we go on, explain to me again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002547|Lennart needed to learn a lesson, how's he going to do that now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002546|You might think you were being helpful, but that wasn't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002545|He needed it, so I got it for him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002544|Who said you could give Lennart his bow?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002543|Why they send me these scraps I'll never know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002542|If I think of anything else, I'll let you know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002541|Yeah, but at least the raptors have moved on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002540|You are a good man. Thanks again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002539|Thanks for nothing!|
INFO_IKENI7_00002538|Oh, I wish I was in Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002536|You're right about that. For all its clean sheets, I always leave Goliet feeling dirty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002535|Then forget it. You're better here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002534|Goliet doesn't send anything unless you go there in person.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002533|Ask Goliet to send some.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002532|I did underestimate you.|Grateful
INFO_IKENI7_00002531|No catch. You look like you need a beer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002530|You'd give me a beer? What's the catch?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002528|You don't have to stay. You can just go back, get a beer and return here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002527|And...the beer. |
INFO_IKENI7_00002526|Go to Goliet? With all the rules and regulations and politics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002525|Then why don't you go and get one?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002524|Here, you can have this one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002523|Beer is the only thing missing from life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002522|I can't remember the last time I had one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002521|Beer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002520|What is that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002519|What else is there? Hunting, fresh air and...well, Goliet does have one thing to offer that can't be found here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002518|Is that all you want from life?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002517|Let alone kill those raptors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002516|I certainly didn't expect you to survive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002515|Patience and persistence, those are the marks of a good hunter.|Quiet, insistent
INFO_IKENI7_00002484|Tell me when you are ready and I will lead you to them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002483|So, I have a reason to trust you...prove me right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002482|I suppose you did help me with Lennart's bow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002481|Yeah, yeah. Valuable life lesson. .|
INFO_IKENI7_00002480|Yes. You will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002479|I'm going to have to try and make a new one.|Resigned
INFO_IKENI7_00002478|Then I have no choice.|Resigned
INFO_IKENI7_00002477|Master Geron?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002476|Geron has your bow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002475|He'll have to learn fast if he's going to stay alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002474|That boy can't find his own ass in broad daylight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002473|Here, I have Lennart's bow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002472|If you find Lennart's bow, you give it to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002471|Normally, I don't have assholes interfering with my business. Lennart must learn his lesson.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002470|You see, this is why I like it out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002469|No, I'm not going to help Lennart.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002468|I told Lennart that I'll help him find his old bow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002467|But, if he hears in advance, he'll try and talk you out of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002466|And this is his lesson.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002465|He will only become a true hunter if he learns.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002464|I told the boy to make a new one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002463|Lennart, your apprentice wants his old bow back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002462|Yeah? Well, there are raptors out there that did. Noise is the best way to get yourself eaten.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002461|I'm helping you out. I didn't come here to hunt.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002460|You'd starve to death in no time if you had to try and live out here alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002459|You're noisier than a constipated troll.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002458|It's obvious you've not trained as a Hunter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002457|Crash around?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002456|The way you crash around out, this isn't your natural environment is it?|Unimpressed
INFO_IKENI7_00002455|What is a guy like you doing out here anyway?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002454|It is a real blessing to be outside again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002453|We can get back to hunting again now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002452|Maybe, I have grown too cynical in my time out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002451|Well, I take my words back, you have proved yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002450|Those raptors are dead meat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002449|But...very well. Let's take care of these raptors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002448|You've already got in my way over Lennart's bow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002447|These are my hunting grounds and I mean to take them back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002446|Right, but you'll have to watch these raptors, they are fast.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002445|Then let's go after them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002444|Very well. You'd better not get us killed.|Gruff
INFO_IKENI7_00002443|Damn it. You have a point...|Reluctant
INFO_IKENI7_00002442|Do you want to kill these raptors, or just hope they go away?|Stress on hope
INFO_IKENI7_00002441|If you give a raptor half a chance, it will make a meal of you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002440|This isn't just about strength. You need to be stealthy, quick.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002439|I don't trust anyone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002438|You can trust me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002437|I'm no amateur.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002436|And, that's what you'd be doing.|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00002435|I don't need another amateur risking my life.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002434|I've had one apprentice almost get me killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002433|Why don't we hunt them together?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002432|But, it looks like they are to the west of here for now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002431|They've been moving around a lot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002430|Have you found the raptors' trail?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002429|No raptor is killing me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002428|That will be easier than collecting them from your body later.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002427|Then can you leave your belongings here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002426|I can take care of these raptors myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002425|About the raptors...|
INFO_IKENI7_00002424|What's the point of living, hey?|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00002423|If you want to try it, I won't stop you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002422|Me, I'm going to have to wait those raptors out. And Goliet will get its meat when I'm ready.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002421|Hunt raptors alone? Sure...why not?!|Is the player an idiot?!
INFO_IKENI7_00002420|Only an idiot wouldn't be.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002419|You're scared?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002418|You should take care of the raptors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002417|I'm not doing that again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002416|We got home with no meat and all of those damned raptors followed us right back here onto our hunting grounds.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002415|I went hunting with Lennart a few days ago. He was so clumsy he brought a whole pack of raptors down on us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002413|While you train people who don't want to be here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002412|Live day to day having to hit your quota of meat to send home?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002411|Sending them here just gives them a chance to get killed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002410|You don't think they deserve a chance?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002409|Apprentices want to be hunters. I get people who don't want to be anything else so get sent here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002408|Do you want to come out here and try it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002407|You sound like you belong in Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002406|Hunting is easy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002405|You don't like apprentices?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002404|It's bad enough they send me these half-baked apprentices.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002403|I want to stay out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002402|Let other people kiss ass and climb ladders.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002401|Nothing wrong with hunting.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002400|Do you want to stay a Hunter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002399|Thank you. Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002398|I can hunt again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002397|This is much better than anything I could've made.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002396|And in one piece. Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002395|I found your bow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002394|He will get over it when I have my bow back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002392|I don't want Geron to learn about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002391|Oh, and this needs to stay between us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002389|They followed us, so they're not around there anymore.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002388|That's a lot of ground to search.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002387|In any case, it was to the north, by the cliffs below under Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002386|Everything happened so fast, I can't really remember the exact spot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002385|Where did you lose your bow?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002383|I will also give you a few shards in addition to my portion from the hunt..|
INFO_IKENI7_00002382|If you do that, you will have my eternal thanks.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002381|I will find your bow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002380|I can pay you, if you do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002379|Please, will you help me?|Desperate appeal
INFO_IKENI7_00002378|But, would you think about it? Please!|
INFO_IKENI7_00002377|I never said that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002376|Would you? Would you bring me my bow?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002375|But, I want to learn from him.|Imploring
INFO_IKENI7_00002374|He says this will teach me a lesson.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002373|But, I don't know how to make one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002372|Hunters make their own bows', 'necessary skill', yeah, yeah.|Quoting Geron
INFO_IKENI7_00002371|Geron will have had his reasons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002370|And you want me to get it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002369|How can I hunt without a bow?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002368|And, he's not taught me how to make one! I need my old one back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002366|Geron, Master Geron, won't let me have one. He says I have to make one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002365|So? Get another bow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002364|I ran.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002363|Yes. I wasn't going to stay there unarmed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002362|You lost your bow?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002361|Then it was too late. We had to run. Master Geron's not really spoken to me since.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002360|I know, I know. We were moving, I stumbled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002359|You dropped your bow?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002358|He let me try and shoot the pack leader, but. .. But I dropped my bow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002357|But, last time we went out, I made too much noise. We were attacked by raptors.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002356|We have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002355|You don't hunt together then?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002354|Seems, he does know what he's talking about. When he talks to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002353|Quick, quick. Yes, that's what Master Geron says.|Down
INFO_IKENI7_00002352|How can I learn if he won't teach me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002351|Maybe you can learn something from him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002350|That's the most he says. But, normally with some swearing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002349|And 'you'll become dead if you can't learn to make your bow come alive'.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002348|Master Geron says that 'life begins when the bow comes alive in your hand'.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002347|I am learning how to survive out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002346|Before anything else, you must be quick.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002345|You don't have a choice when you're out here in the wilderness.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002344|There's not much on Magalan I haven't fought.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002343|Have you seen swamp spiders? Or trolls? Did you fight them?|Excited
INFO_IKENI7_00002342|You are? What have you seen?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002341|I'm a born hunter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002340|Do you have any hunting experience?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002338|I'm an apprentice.|Proud
INFO_IKENI7_00002337|You're learning to be a Hunter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002336|I just wish I could, but he doesn't seem to like me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002335|At least I will be if Master Geron will teach me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002334|I am Lennart, Berserker, prospective Hunter and apprentice.|Proud, but weedy
INFO_IKENI7_00002333|Who are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00002003|We all need to remember our place in it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00002000|You, me, all the people here, we are all part of Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001999|This place might be a good choice for defense, but it doesn't exactly connect us with nature.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001995|And yet, the only thing that's saved us are the gifts Magalan has given us. Food, water, shelter. She saved us. Now, we must save her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001994|That's what they said before the Comet hit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001993|Sounds like superstitious nonsense.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001992|Why do you build these huts then?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001982|Oh, of course it can. It's magic.|With a smile, playing to the audience.
INFO_IKENI7_00001981|Leather armor can't stop energy weapons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001979|Have a beer and you can taste it!|
INFO_IKENI7_00001978|What's so good about nature?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001977|They're unnatural.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001976|Elex rots whatever it touches. Look at the Albs. They might as well be mutants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001975|Hah, are you one of those people that looks at a shiny gun and thinks it's progress?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001974|Maybe, the Berserkers just got lucky.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001972|You ask the Albs. Their technology, against our magic and they're the ones in the ground.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001971|What? You think you can't kill someone with a sword?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001970|Why do you use such old weapons?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001969|Tell me...|
INFO_IKENI7_00001895|The men at the Mana shrine informed me the stolen Elex was returned and that was your doing.|Pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00001894|It would save you a trip to Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001893|Guess, we're just going to have to sit and hope someone remember us sometime then.|Depressed about the supplies
INFO_IKENI7_00001892|What? And, and she was someone I thought scare death away with a scowl. |
INFO_IKENI7_00001891|Sinda is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001890|Do you ask me that expecting to receive my pledge? You are responsible for the death of a citizen of Goliet. You're lucky anyone here is still willing to give you a chance.|Disbelief
INFO_IKENI7_00001889|Yes. Yes, now there is something I don't understand.|Deflated
INFO_IKENI7_00001888|But, Albs can cast magic.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001886|And, they're changing, becoming less human. While our Mana helps us cast magic, it's toxic to the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001885|But, they have retreated into Xacor only to be seen when they come to kill.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001884|If we knew that, perhaps we could talk with them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001883|They have a love of Elex, a need for it, but as to why?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001882|Most people know the Albs split from the Clerics, but I don't know anyone who knows why they split from them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001881|You think? Maybe. I don't know, they're a mystery to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001880|In the short term. They don't even know what they are fighting for. How can they ever be victorious if they let themselves become machines?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001879|Victorious. They're beating you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001878|Elex has given the Albs strength.|plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00001877|And, right at the time machines were foresworn, and we started to make Magalan pure again, Mana was given to us. Magic is nature's reward for our rejection of technology.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001876|And, so Amrek and the forefathers decreed that all technology that poisoned our world should be forbidden.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001875|Listen, there are books from the Great Fall that say there were other ways to power machines, but that most of them poisoned the air and the soil.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001873|You sound like one of those technophiles. Looking forward and not knowing their history.|Disparaging
INFO_IKENI7_00001871|Why not do this and use technology?|Stress on 'and'
INFO_IKENI7_00001870|You will find our healers on the upper ring, they will show you how we use its power.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001869|We cure the soil of Elex's poison and use it for healing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001867|Those monsters throw people into their convertors. Alive, or dead, it doesn't matter to them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001866|You're comparing us to those inhuman creatures?|Offended
INFO_IKENI7_00001865|So, you extract Elex just like the Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001864|Stormson is dead.|Alternative start to the conversation
INFO_IKENI7_00001862|The murderer Stormson is still alive, although you were sent to stop him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001861|That's good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001860|Yes, I did.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001859|People say that you found the murderer Stormson.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001858|Once I am inside that leviathan, I can't seem to find the right thing and time is precious when the mutants are after you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001857|I am trained in combat, but not technology.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001856|Why can't you get the parts?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001855|I've only just escaped with my life each time.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001853|Here are the keys.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001852|First things first, you can give me the keys to those chests back, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001851|Thank you for telling me, but...please, if you don't mind. I need to be alone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001849|He was loyal, I don't care what they say, he was loyal to our cause. He believed ours was the only way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001847|What did he get himself mixed up in?|Sad
INFO_IKENI7_00001846|Your friend Stormson is dead.|If the player has learned that Stormson was dead after the quest started.
INFO_IKENI7_00001844|Dead? You're sure?|Shocked
INFO_IKENI7_00001843|Stormson's dead.|Option 1.3 if Stormson's dead before the Quest has started.
INFO_IKENI7_00001842|That's sad. Especially as it means there's no one to harvest those roots. What a waste... Say! How about you decide to harvest them in his place? Then I could give them to someone who needs them.|2
INFO_IKENI7_00001841|Born can't help us, he's dead.|1 If Born is dead
INFO_IKENI7_00001840|Here, I don't have much, unfortunately. It's hard to make a living in exile.|Giving him money
INFO_IKENI7_00001839|Just give me what you have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001838|I'm only just home. It'll take me a while to get myself back on my feet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001837|Grateful?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001836|I know. I'm sorry. I am grateful.|Sincere.
INFO_IKENI7_00001835|Getting you back here cost me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001834|Thanks for the mystery.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001833|That claw will help you when the time is right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001832|And here, take this claw. It's...important. Keep it, don't sell it, don't throw it away, don't talk about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001831|And, I will learn if she can be trusted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001830|Drog will keep an eye on her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001828|Her debt is paid, I will assign her to duty at the gate. You will find her there once she has returned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001827|I will send a patrol to bring her back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001826|I hope for your sake that she can reform, because if you pay for her I will look to you if she comes to my attention again...|Mild warning
INFO_IKENI7_00001825|Everything matters. But, if you pay for the damage she caused, she may return from exile. That is the Law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001824|Does that matter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001823|You could, but why would you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001822|Can I settle her debt?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001821|She was exiled on clear evidence according to the Law.|Firm
INFO_IKENI7_00001820|I don't know why you would do that, but you must have your reasons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001819|I will pay Katta's debt.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001817|I see you are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001816|Katta? I do if you're talking about the thief Katta?|Checking
INFO_IKENI7_00001815|Do you know Katta?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001814|Not here and not even if I could get back to Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001813|But, I haven't got the money|
INFO_IKENI7_00001812|Well, Berserker Law does allow you to pay for the damage you've caused.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001811|It's worth a try.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001810|You mean buy myself out of exile?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001809|Maybe, there's another way. Is there someone you could pay?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001808|I know he didn't play by the rules, but he was a friend. The only one I thought could help me.|Sad
INFO_IKENI7_00001807|That's terrible! I suppose his deals finally caught up with him.|Shocked then sad.
INFO_IKENI7_00001806|Alrik is dead.|If Alrik dies after the quest has started.
INFO_IKENI7_00001804|He's one of the good guys. Well, he'd sell his grandmother for the right price, but you always know where you are with him. He should help me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001803|He is dead.|Option if Alrik is dead at this point
INFO_IKENI7_00001802|You shouldn't speak ill of the dead, but I happily made an exception in this case.|if he died
INFO_IKENI7_00001801|Let's let sleeping Drogs lie, hey?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001800|But, that's not our concern.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001799|Hah, it won't please him that Drog escaped judgement by dying!|If Drog is dead
INFO_IKENI7_00001798|He should be convinced when he finds what's in Drog's chest.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001797|Next, I do the dangerous part and tell Cormag that Drog has been the thief all along.|or this one
INFO_IKENI7_00001796|Right you are, best for you not to be carrying evidence.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001794|He isn't here to argue is he?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001793|Yeah? Well, that makes it easier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001792|Drog is dead.|Option if Drog is dead
INFO_IKENI7_00001791|Oh, you're paying. One way, or another!|fight starts
INFO_IKENI7_00001790|I'm not paying.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001789|You're right. I want more than that!|
INFO_IKENI7_00001788|I'm not paying you a single shard.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001787|One more thing...|
INFO_IKENI7_00001786|The Outlaws don't care about a man's past.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001785|I've been a Berserker since I was born.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001784|Why would the Clerics trust me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001783|Choice?|Sneering at this
INFO_IKENI7_00001782|Hopefully, I'll never see you, or Angrim again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001781|But, you aren't completely wrong. I will try my luck with them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001780|It will if he catches me working for the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001779|Angrim's word shouldn't matter to you now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001778|Would Angrim agree with you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001777|They'll catch up with you one day, the Berserkers, or the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001776|Once an Alb, always an Alb.|Envious, bitter
INFO_IKENI7_00001775|I don't care where you go.|Plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00001774|Your life is your choice.|option 8.1
INFO_IKENI7_00001773|The Clerics are a better choice.|option 8.2
INFO_IKENI7_00001772|This will be enough to join the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001771|Look, everyone deserves a new start.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001770|I hope your lies strangle you like they strangled me.|Referring to being framed.
INFO_IKENI7_00001769|Won't stop me hoping someone else finds out your deception.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001768|Very generous, that should keep your secret safe, from my lips anyway.|Sly
INFO_IKENI7_00001767|Here. This should be enough to shut your mouth.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001766|Aw, you...you can just keep your mouth shut.|one-liner, if the player helped Katta
INFO_IKENI7_00001765|You're going to give me them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001764|And for that, I need shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001763|I want what you got, a new start.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001762|For my silence?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001761|What do you want?|option 7.2
INFO_IKENI7_00001760|You see, I don't need proof you are an Alb, I just need to put the word out that you are.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001758|Then someone will turn up the truth.|option 7.1 This is triggered by a text-only option called "Say nothing"
INFO_IKENI7_00001756|Then people will start talking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001754|I know enough people to put the word out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001753|That's not how rumors work is it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001752|We'll see about that.|fight starts
INFO_IKENI7_00001751|It's not me who'll die here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001750|Pay me, or I'll take them from your corpse.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001749|Give me the shards and it will.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001748|So, your life means nothing?|optional part if the player was victorious against him before
INFO_IKENI7_00001746|I've got nothing more to lose.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001745|You killed me when you had me sent out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001743|The dead don't talk.|option 6.2
INFO_IKENI7_00001742|You think people would listen to your accusations?|option 6.1
INFO_IKENI7_00001741|Think you're so smart? How's this for smart?|all lead to this one.  Suspecting there's something wrong with the player character, he is on a fishing trip to cause trouble rather than knowing this as a definite fact.
INFO_IKENI7_00001740|They never did find the pilot did they? I wonder why that is?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001739|You turned up by Goliet just after that Alb raider crashed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001737|And, you're not denying it, are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001736|So, you don't know. You're guessing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001735|Because, Alrik would never have had the balls on his own, and I know Alrik came and named me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001734|You went on a stealing spree in Goliet and put the gear in my chest? You framed me?|Jogging the player's memory
INFO_IKENI7_00001733|Should I help you jog your memory?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001731|Smart mouth aren't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001730|How do you know I framed you?|option 5.3
INFO_IKENI7_00001729|I did you a favor. You hated your job.|option 5.2
INFO_IKENI7_00001728|What are you talking about?|Option 5.1
INFO_IKENI7_00001727|I was thrown out of Goliet because of you, you bastard.|Conditional on the player having followed Alrik's plan to frame Drog
INFO_IKENI7_00001726|Give me one reason I shouldn't kill you right here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001725|You show your face here?|Conditional on the player having followed Alrik's plan to frame Drog
INFO_IKENI7_00001724|So, I have to avoid giving them anything over to worry about. That said, I do have some business that I have to take care of.|Turning serious
INFO_IKENI7_00001722|I will do my guard duty at the gate. They'll be watching me to make sure they made the right decision in letting me back.|Relaxed
INFO_IKENI7_00001721|What will you do now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001716|And Drog has gone too. If ever there was a Berserker who needed to be sent away to see some of the world, it was Drog.|She dislikes Drog, pleased
INFO_IKENI7_00001715|So, it's you I have to thank for getting me home.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001714|But, he couldn't, wouldn't have done it without you.|She knows Alrik wouldn't have followed through., praising the player
INFO_IKENI7_00001713|It was Alrik's plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001711|I don't know what to say. I never thought I would see Goliet again.|After the player has got Katta back to Goliet
INFO_IKENI7_00001710|Speak to her when you have time. I'm sure she'll be grateful.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001709|Imagine that. Someone in charge of what comes in and goes out and she just happens to owe us a favor. A big favor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001708|Katta is as free as a bird. Well, if birds had guard duty. She's been given Drog's job on the gate.|All options lead to this line
INFO_IKENI7_00001707|Guess. I mean, do you know someone who just returned to Goliet and is looking for a job?|Pleased with himself
INFO_IKENI7_00001706|So, who will take Drog's post at the gate?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001705|Now, we'll see how he gets along without his clan to help him.|If he survived
INFO_IKENI7_00001704|Besides, Drog was an asshole. Do you know he once accused me of being a thief too?|Mock offense
INFO_IKENI7_00001703|Brothers in trade. Loyalty in money. I told you you could trust me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001702|Thank you for your help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001701|Cormag exiled him..|If Drog was exiled
INFO_IKENI7_00001700|What about Drog?|If Drog survived
INFO_IKENI7_00001699|Cormag has sent a messenger, Katta will be released.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001698|Yes! You should've seen Cormag's face when everything was there in Drog's chest. He hates being wrong.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00001697|Did it work?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001696|Good news!|
INFO_IKENI7_00001695|Wait here, I will be right back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001694|But...it's best if I speak with Cormag alone. If he sees us together, he'll be suspicious. He's like that.|Both lead to this line
INFO_IKENI7_00001693|Next, I do the dangerous part and tell Cormag that Drog has been the real thief all along, so he should let Katta come back.|Either this one
INFO_IKENI7_00001692|So, what's next?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001691|Good work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001690|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001689|Did you put the claws in the other chests like I said?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001688|I stored the goods and the claw in Drog's chest.|After the player has done it
INFO_IKENI7_00001687|Point is, I had them, now you've got them and you can get Katta free. Problems are solved when Alrik's involved.|Saying the last bit as a sales slogan for himself.
INFO_IKENI7_00001686|If I tell you that, I'll ruin my aura of mystique.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001685|How did you get those keys?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001682|Here, but don't let those keys get traced back to me. I'd rather not end up at the end of a rope!|
INFO_IKENI7_00001681|Well, I suppose you could use the keys. I happen to have picked them up earlier.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001680|Isn't there a simpler way?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001678|Break the lock, pick the lock, stare at it until it drops off...I'm sure you can think of something.|Sigh, does he have to tell the player everything?!
INFO_IKENI7_00001677|How can I break into Sinda's and Born's chests?|Option 7.2
INFO_IKENI7_00001676|Then Drog gets into trouble, Katta gets out of trouble and we get to bask in the glory. I told you. I'm all about solutions.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001675|Loot out, claw in for Sinda's chest and Born's chest. Loot in, claw in for Drog's.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001674|It's child's play!|
INFO_IKENI7_00001673|Complicated? I pulled this same plan off when I was seven years old.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001672|Your plan is too complicated.|Option 7.1
INFO_IKENI7_00001671|Then...you put those valuables, those 'stolen' valuables, into a chest in Drog's house together with another claw. That's going to make him look very, very guilty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001670|So, take these claws. One for Sinda's chest, one for Born's and one for Drog's. And get the job done, everything clear?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001669|Because, it's the sign of... well, that doesn't matter for now. Let's just say that when people see the claw they will take it as proof of Drog's guilt.|Enthusiatic then realising he should be keeping this secret.
INFO_IKENI7_00001668|Why a claw?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001667|So, here's the plan. You find those chests and break into them. You steal the valuables and leave a claw behind in their place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001666|Everyone knows they've got chests of valuables.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001665|Go to the Sinda and Born's huts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001664|He's a prime 'A one', blackmailing asshole who uses his position to rob people and make them feel small. What's not to like?|Talking fast, impassioned. He really doesn't like Drog.
INFO_IKENI7_00001663|Do I have to do all the thinking myself?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001662|What should I steal?|Option
INFO_IKENI7_00001661|You don't like Drog?|Option
INFO_IKENI7_00001659|Come on, you must know him? He guards the main city gate. You like as not saw him on the way in here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001657|The guy who snitched on Katta. Drog! He tried to fit her for the crime, now we'll do that to him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001656|Scapegoat?|Both lead to this line
INFO_IKENI7_00001655|Somewhere it incriminates our scapegoat of course!|
INFO_IKENI7_00001654|So, what's the right place to leave the 'stuff'?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001653|You grab the right stuff and leave it in the right place and she gets right out. Simple.|Option 6.2
INFO_IKENI7_00001652|What do I have to do?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001651|I'm not sticking my neck in the noose without someone there to stop me falling.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001650|If you're out of it, I'm out of it.|Option 6.1
INFO_IKENI7_00001649|Me? Keep me out of it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001648|See, always knew you were quick. So, all you need to do is steal the right stuff.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001647|That would be proof the accusations were false.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001646|So, what happens if those thefts continue now she's in exile?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001645|Correct.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001644|Okay, listen. She's accused of theft, right?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001643|What's your plan to save her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001642|All right, all right. I will do it. It isn't as if I didn't have a plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001641|Is that any way for a friend to act?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001640|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001639|Will you accept a no?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001638|Are you going to help her, or not?|Both lead to this line
INFO_IKENI7_00001637|What's loyalty? I'm an honest man, I'm loyal to money.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001636|What about loyalty?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001635|If she's got a Warlord pissed then, yeah, she's guilty and it's safest to stay away from her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001634|Guilt? Innocence? That's all about who's deciding isn't it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001633|So, you're saying she is guilty of the thefts? That Cormag was right to convict her?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001632|Doesn't everyone say that when they get caught?|Option 5.2
INFO_IKENI7_00001631|We were. But, a Warlord's judgment changes everything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001630|I thought you were friends?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001629|She says she's innocent.|Option 5.1
INFO_IKENI7_00001628|A man's got to be careful. It's dangerous to throw in with the wrong people.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001627|All right, all right, as it's you I'm talking to. Yeah, I know her.|Admitting it
INFO_IKENI7_00001626|She's already told me she knows you.|Straight
INFO_IKENI7_00001625|Katta? Katta? I don't know a Katta.|Pretending ignorance.
INFO_IKENI7_00001624|Katta needs your help.|If the player has already spoken to Katta
INFO_IKENI7_00001623|Why not? Thank you. Though I don't see me adding more entries while I'm stuck out here.|Giving in, gratitude.
INFO_IKENI7_00001620|So, I can remember the good times?|Wry
INFO_IKENI7_00001619|Do you want your diary back?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001618|One thing about Alrik, he's always got a plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001617|If you could go to Goliet and speak to Alrik, he could come up with a plan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001616|Hah! You have met him! Believe it, or not, he's one of the good guys. Sure, he'd sell his grandmother for the right price, but you know where you are with him. He should help me.|Genuinely amused at the player recognising who Alrik is.
INFO_IKENI7_00001615|No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001614|Do you know Alrik?|Considering whether to suggest him
INFO_IKENI7_00001613|If I took you to him he'd probably try and sell you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001612|Yes, I know Alrik|
INFO_IKENI7_00001611|Is there anyone in Goliet who will help you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001610|But, we won't persuade Cormag alone. We would need help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001609|Of course I want to go back. Exile wouldn't be punishment if people didn't want to go back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001608|A warm bed, high walls, the chance to live rather than just survive?|Listing the benefits of Goliet
INFO_IKENI7_00001607|Don't you want to go back?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001606|Then he'll condemn you too. And then you'll end up exiled out here, or worse.|Calm warning
INFO_IKENI7_00001605|Then I'll threaten him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001604|I'm not sure talking will convince him otherwise.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001603|And it will put you up against the Warlord Cormag? He's convinced I'm guilty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001601|I mean...I'm not used to someone, anyone saying they'd help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001600|No, don't take that the wrong way.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001599|Why would you? I don't know you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001598|I will persuade them to let you go home.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001597|I just have to accept the fact that I'm stuck out here for good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001596|And, who's going to do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001594|Tempting though that might be, I can't see it helping me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001593|Kill a Warlord?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001592|And, I can't get back there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001591|Any evidence is back in Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001590|Prove yourself innocent.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001589|You should kill the person who sent you here.|cold plus one
INFO_IKENI7_00001588|Someone else would have to prove me innocent.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001587|If I leave this place, the powers in Goliet will send a patrol to bring me back here and chances are they wouldn't bring me back alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001586|Exile isn't just a sentence to leave, it's a sentence to stay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001585|I can't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001584|If you don't like it here, you should leave.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001583|Exiled, lost, running away, yes. Chosen to come of their own freewill, no.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001582|You weren't? I've not met many people who chose to come here.|Curious
INFO_IKENI7_00001581|Hah. A sense of humor. You'll need that here.|Amused
INFO_IKENI7_00001580|Being free means you can make mistakes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001579|Why would you choose to come to this fly eaten, arse end of nowhere?|Comes from either option, pushing, genuinely surprised
INFO_IKENI7_00001578|And, here is where pleased you?|Firmer, still polite, but pushing for an answer
INFO_IKENI7_00001577|I'm free to go where I please.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001576|I wasn't exiled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001575|But, then maybe that's something you know about? The only people I tend to see out here are on patrol, or in exile.|Curious, fishing for information
INFO_IKENI7_00001574|The next I'm accused of theft and sentenced without a chance to defend myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001573|One day I'm a loyal Berserker.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001572|You tell me.|Resigned
INFO_IKENI7_00001571|What exactly happened to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001569|And, that brought you all the way out here? I didn't realize I was such a good writer.|Uncertain what to make of this.
INFO_IKENI7_00001568|I found your diary in Goliet.|Conditional on the player having found the diary.
INFO_IKENI7_00001563|If you want to rest before you go back and tell him that, you are welcome to stay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001562|Are you here to spy for Cormag? If you're here to claim payment, I didn't steal those things, so I can't pay you back.|Calm, raising her suspicions
INFO_IKENI7_00001561|You're welcome to stay, if you need a place to shelter for a couple of days.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001560|You don't have the look of someone who came here looking for food, or shelter, what brings you here?|Growing curious.
INFO_IKENI7_00001559|You can put the two together.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001558|If you want a meal - There's meat and there's a fire. |Matter of fact
INFO_IKENI7_00001557|Incomer, or outcast, you can find a place to sleep back there.|Matter of fact, she deals with arrivals every day.
INFO_IKENI7_00001556|And, there's only one of me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001555|Once more it comes back to me to resolve this directly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001554|I'm glad it's the Pilgrim and the Warlord who have to decide all these things. It makes my head hurt.|With a smile
INFO_IKENI7_00001553|Maybe one day we will manage it, but until then...it's useful. Everyone spends it so we do too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001551|Yes, but the concentration in it is just too low to produce Mana.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001550|It's Elex isn't it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001548|You mean, why not turn it into Mana?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001547|If Elex is so bad, why do you trade using Elexit?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001546|Count on it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001544|More than my word. You'll get a glowing testimony that will make you shine like the Pilgrim himself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001543|I'll pay you for your word.|option 4.2 Accepting
INFO_IKENI7_00001542|After all, it's my job as a guard to keep people safe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001540|Then we can watch each others' backs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001539|I'm not paying for your 'word'.|option 4.1  sceptical, plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00001538|For instance, no one's going to listen to anything you say after I've beaten seven shades of crap out of you right here.|fight starts
INFO_IKENI7_00001537|If mine is worthless, imagine how little yours counts for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001536|Your word is worthless, asshole.|option 4.3  Hostile - aggressive
INFO_IKENI7_00001535|Of course, giving you my word would be a pretty big favor.|Turning to business
INFO_IKENI7_00001534|So, if I did that, I'd probably need a favor in return. Say, in the form of shards.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001533|You need pledges if you want promotion. And we need reliable people in our clan.|Explaining
INFO_IKENI7_00001531|Aw, now I really need a drink.|emphasis on 'really'.
INFO_IKENI7_00001530|Beer.|To the point
INFO_IKENI7_00001529|Least you can do is get me a pint.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001528|Come on, I'm stuck here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001527|It'll take more beer than you can carry to go to my head.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001526|You're going to get drunk on guard duty?|Option
INFO_IKENI7_00001525|And bring me a something back?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001524|So, friend, why don't you head down to the tavern...|Stressing friend
INFO_IKENI7_00001523|Seeing as you're looking to settle down here you'll be needing to make friends, won't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001522|What now?|Impatient
INFO_IKENI7_00001521|Wait, wait. One moment.|After the player has joined the Berserkers
INFO_IKENI7_00001520|Don't do anything forbidden by our Laws. It is that simple.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001519|And that means?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001518|If anything comes up I'll let you know.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001517|Leave, leave now while you can.|Warning
INFO_IKENI7_00001516|But, maybe, I am free now. Travel safe and thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001515|Hah, so I used to say. Superstitious raptor shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001514|Curses aren't real. You're free.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001513|I will rest first. I won't believe this curse lifted until I see it. And, I will need my energy in case those mutants come back.|Wary, nervous
INFO_IKENI7_00001511|Will you take the Converter parts to Goliet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001509|And, so the mutants come again. And it doesn't matter what I do I can't get to the parts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001508|And, then Jora sends me here to find Converter parts.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001488|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001487|Load of old hooey of course, but even so, with his name on the sword, it's almost priceless. Almost.|Contradicting the story
INFO_IKENI7_00001486|They say that fifty years ago, Eisenfaust destroyed an entire army of the Cleric's fighting machines using just this sword.|In awe
INFO_IKENI7_00001485|No, I have not forgotten that. It was an honorable act.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001484|Don't forget I saved Eisenfaust's sword.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001483|For that, all Berserkers must be grateful.|Grateful
INFO_IKENI7_00001482|You helped foil the plot to steal Erik Eisenfaust's sword.|Grateful
INFO_IKENI7_00001481|I can't prove anything, but suspicions don't always have to be proven.|Suspicious
INFO_IKENI7_00001480|And, don't think the fact that Eisenfaust's sword disappeared at the point you arrived has gone unnoticed.|Warning
INFO_IKENI7_00001479|You have my thanks and the thanks of all true Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001478|You did well in bringing this to me. It doesn't bear thinking what its loss would have meant.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001457|And the reward?|

INFO_IKENI7_00001455|I'd better move it soon, Ragnar's going to go crazy when he realizes it's gone.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001454|Listen closely and you can hear it. 'Sell me, Alrik'. 'Charge big, Alrik.'|

INFO_IKENI7_00001441|It seems the People of the Old World understood the value of that even back before the Great Fall.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001440|You will get an idea how beautiful it must have been here before the Comet struck.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001439|If you want, go up to one of the higher balconies and have a look at the view.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001438|A rare relic of the Old World, hey?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001437|What is this building?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001435|No one will cheat you here. But, you should not expect charity.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001430|The supplies you took them made them ill.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001429|Only, your support was anything but helpful wasn't it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001427|Ah, yes. That was something.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001426|Don't forget that I helped Irdor. And the Cultivators.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001425|A man should know his value. You will get paid and you should be satisfied with the rewards you're given.|Purposefully repeating the phrase.
INFO_IKENI7_00001420|Some say Eisenfaust was the real founder of the Berserkers. That he took Amrek's dreams and made them real.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001418|Not Ragnar's either. Who knows how he got the sword, but it wasn't legitimate, trust me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001417|Just not from my family.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001416|Well, yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001414|I'll give you a reasonably sized stack of Elexit for it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001412|You've got to have heard of him. He was one of the greatest warriors ever to fight for the Berserkers. Eisenfaust is a legend here. Kids worship him, warriors want to be him.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001406|Just tell me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001405|Well, if you're sure? Once we talk about this, you'll be committed. It's all about trust on this one.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001404|Tell me about it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001403|Well, there is one thing, but it's a bit 'special'.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001402|What's the rarest item you are looking for?|Option 4.9
INFO_IKENI7_00001401|Warlord of warlords. Mighty and just. He is an example to us all.|Proud

INFO_IKENI7_00001395|Yeah, yeah, okay, okay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001394|I won. Now, you pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001393|All right, all right, you made your point!|
INFO_IKENI7_00001392|And you're the one to shut it, are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001391|Drog. Time you learned to keep that mouth shut.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001390|There, what happened to that big mouth of yours? Swollen shut now is it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001389|You were right to be afraid.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001387|Drog put in a good word for you, but you impressed the wrong man. Others have paid for taking his word before now, you will need more than this to convince me|Disdainful of Drog
INFO_IKENI7_00001385|And, seeing as you played by the rules, I'll put in a word for you with the bossman himself - Ragnar, Warlord of the Hooded Crows.|Helpful
INFO_IKENI7_00001384|Good, I thought you might see sense.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001383|I don't want trouble.|Option 3.1

INFO_IKENI7_00001349|Who is in charge here?|

INFO_IKENI7_00001340|Where is? With the Albs looking to tear down this whole world?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001338|This place doesn't sound too safe.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001337|Then you'll find work. We're short of people since the attacks began.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001336|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001335|Can you handle a weapon?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001334|So, what can I do to earn my stay?|

INFO_IKENI7_00001321|Payment?! You've made my men sick! Whatever you thought you were doing, you left men in the forest with their guts in knots. Be glad I'm not force feeding you whatever you gave them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001320|Irdor asked for food. I took him food. Where's my payment?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001318|And, sickness and diarrhea really aren't words you want to hear around food production.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001317|It will be days before they are able to work at full capacity again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001316|Tell me, why am I hearing only complaints from the Cultivators? Could it have something to do with the food you took them?|

INFO_IKENI7_00001311|Rather than roll around in someone else's.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001310|It's better to make that shit yourself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001309|If there's one thing I've learned, if you're going to end up in the shit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001308|Those poor dumb pricks up there, they come out here to get eaten by Raptors because some other dumb prick tells them to!|Considering

INFO_IKENI7_00001297|Well, it would be a different life for you there. Where Edan teaches magic, in Ignadon there is technology. I think you could like it there.|Laying out a hook to bait the player to going to Ignadon

INFO_IKENI7_00001283|What about you? Are you going to pledge allegiance to the Berserkers? Run off to the Outlaw way of life, or follow an interest in technology to the Clerics?|Dodging the answer
INFO_IKENI7_00001282|Certainly the Clerics believe differently about technology, but that's no reason to hate them. Is it?|Fishing for a reaction
INFO_IKENI7_00001281|What I don't understand is the hatred for Clerics here. The wars of the past are long gone, the enmity should be buried.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001280|The people of Tavar might as well be mutants the way they turn on everyone and everything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001279|All of which is a thousand times better than you can expect from the Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001278|And, if you follow their Laws, you will find acceptance here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001276|Don't get me wrong, the people here can be fair, they help those around them. And, there's the wonder that is Berserker magic.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001275|Is there anything else you don't like about Berserkers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001274|The Clerics think that, with Calaan's guidance, technology can sort out this mess of a planet. That it can mean safety and progress for all the Free People.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001273|So, the Clerics want to see that golden age return. We don't want to abandon all the things our people achieved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001272|So?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001271|You know about the Comet that struck our planet? Well, back before the impact, Magalan had technology that could take you into space, or to the bottom of the ocean.|Selling the dream
INFO_IKENI7_00001270|Tell me more about the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001269|Clerics, Albs, Outlaws, all will see you as one of us from this point.|Solemn

INFO_IKENI7_00001265|You have recognized the value of our people.|Solemn
INFO_IKENI7_00001264|But, if you swear your loyalty here, you must mean it. You must turn your back on all the other factions.|Solemn
INFO_IKENI7_00001263|So, I give you the chance to join our community. Continue to serve us faithfully and you will climb the ranks here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001262|You have won approval faster than I thought you would.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001259|Just make sure you abide by the Law and don't trade forbidden items.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001257|Then I grant you permission to trade in Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001256|The other Warlords have given their approval.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001255|But, very well, I will give you my pledge.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001253|He's fairly inflexible when it comes to the Law.|Deadpan
INFO_IKENI7_00001252|So, you broke the Law and Angrim won't support you?|Realising why the player is there
INFO_IKENI7_00001251|I need your pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001250|Good. Then you have my pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001249|Agreed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001248|And it would be for me to choose when and how that debt is to be repaid.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001247|If I was to offer you another chance and give you my pledge, that you would put you in my debt.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00001246|And you decided to cross that line.|Firm
INFO_IKENI7_00001245|I warned you of the consequences of breaking our Laws.|Firm
INFO_IKENI7_00001244|Begging won't earn you respect.|Cold
INFO_IKENI7_00001243|You want me to beg for help?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001242|Yes, I have not forgotten that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001241|So, what reason have I to take that risk?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001240|I dealt with the Cleric in Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001239|You certainly did well in that task.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001238|I took care of Stormson.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001237|Yes, I have not forgotten that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001236|Well, I passed the test at the Pit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001235|If I were to agree to that, then your actions would reflect on me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001234|If I put my name to yours.|Considering the player
INFO_IKENI7_00001233|I'm seeking promotion, will you give me your pledge?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001232|But, my word is not enough to give you progress on its own. All three Warlords must agree.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001231|Very well. It is a poor thing that Elexit can stand in for loyalty, but difficult times change the rules.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001230|Here, this should pay for my redemption.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001229|You can pay for the damage you've caused with Elexit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001228|But, maybe some can.|Coming to a decision

INFO_IKENI7_00001224|So, how can I gain your trust?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001223|I can only speak for myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001222|For their part, you'll have to ask Angrim and Cormag.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001221|How can I do that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001219|You will need to win the trust of the Warlords.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001218|If you really wish to prove your worth.|Reluctantly offering another chance
INFO_IKENI7_00001217|You can talk all you want, it's actions that count.|Unconvinced by the player, rebuke
INFO_IKENI7_00001216|Is there anyway to change your mind about me?|When the player has failed to do enough positive quests they must persuade the Warlords to give tem another chance.
INFO_IKENI7_00001215|There is nothing I can do for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001214|But, my head means a lot to me too, so unless things are good between you and Ragnar...|
INFO_IKENI7_00001213|Listen, and don't take this personally, because I like you.|If he's not friends with Ragnar/the Berserkers

INFO_IKENI7_00001210|I'm sorry, Ragnar's put the word out. I can't trade with you.|If the player has caused problems
INFO_IKENI7_00001209|Look around, tell me what you need.|If Sinda can trade
INFO_IKENI7_00001208|I'll show you who's made a mistake!|Moving to attack the player.
INFO_IKENI7_00001207|Threatening me is a mistake.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001206|Have some fucking sense! Help me. Get paid, don't get dead. Dead helps no one.|Threatening
INFO_IKENI7_00001205|So, you come down, out here, into this wilderness and you think that's a good answer?|Are you stupid?
INFO_IKENI7_00001204|I won't do business with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001203|Think carefully before you act in future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001202|And you will be barred from joining the Berserkers for now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001201|And until such time as you do, you will be forbidden to trade here.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001199|I have people telling me you should be exiled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001198|Far from getting good reports...|
INFO_IKENI7_00001197|You have created more problems here than you have solved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001196|We could have used you. But, you have made your choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001195|It is a shame you have pledged your allegiance to another cause.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001194|Think about it. Maybe, someday, when you are ready we will teach you about our magic.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001193|You have proved a friend to the Berserkers, I think you should consider joining us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001191|You didn't exactly help Irdor, did you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001190|You helped Irdor. Something we neglected to do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001189|And, worse still, you involved my wife in this deception. How does that speak your case?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001188|I've heard you helped a Cleric escape from Goliet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001187|You helped Hakon complete his mission. That speaks well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001186|I have heard, you uncovered a Cleric and brought him to justice. That action carries a lot of weight, you did well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001185|My wife doesn't trust you. That doesn't give me confidence in your motives for being here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001184|My wife seems to hold you in great favor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001183|Ornir told me that you failed to help him deal with an Outlaw he was worried about. |Negative
INFO_IKENI7_00001182|You made quite an impression on the workers. Ornir says you were a great help to him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001181|Jora says you didn't acquire the Converter parts he needed. That was a missed opportunity.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001180|Jora says that you found him the Converter parts he needed. That impressed him enough to earn you his pledge.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001179|You have earned a just reward.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001175|All told, I am pleased with you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001174|You didn't help Born harvest the healing roots when he need your help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001173|Born was grateful for the help you gave him with the harvest. He has spoken up for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001172|You helped protect the Seedlings from mutants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001171|You found Rogar and reported that to us. That speaks to your character.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001170|Angrim should learn of this. He needs to know that Rogar is dead.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001159|Whatever my thoughts, the Laws we have now are the ones we must follow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001156|Dedicated, not harsh. And, sometimes dedication can blind us to other ways of thinking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001155|But, they could be made more flexible. The bough that bends in the storm doesn't break.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001154|Abolished? No.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001153|The Laws should be abolished.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001152|You think other Berserkers are too harsh?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001150|Death and exile shouldn't be the only sentences. There should be reward in repentance. Leniency could save us valuable people.|

INFO_IKENI7_00001092|You're an ass, you know that? Here, take these shards and let Akira know I'm doing all right.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001091|We've all got expenses. You'll need to pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001090|I don't have much Elexit, had to leave most of my things in Goliet, I've had to replace my gear since I got here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001089|Thanks, you know, I thought Angrim would send someone after me, but there's no way I thought that person would leave me alive. It seems not everyone in Goliet is an asshole.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001088|I'll make sure she gets your message.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001087|If you want a messenger service, you'll need to pay for it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001086|And, if she can ever tear herself from her plants, she knows where to find me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001085|But, if you do go back to Goliet, tell Akira I'm doing all right? |
INFO_IKENI7_00001083|Now you do sound like you've come from Angrim. No, I'll live, now I've finally got a chance to|
INFO_IKENI7_00001082|You'd prefer it if I just killed you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001081|How can I trust you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001080|You travel half the world and you'll let me live?|Doubtful
INFO_IKENI7_00001079|I am sworn to the Clerics now, not the Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001078|The Law is there for a reason, it must be upheld.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001076|You really want to serve Angrim? You've bought into their laws?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001075|You betrayed the Berserkers and the sentence has been made. You must die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001074|Angrim wants you dead. But, I'll let you live.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001073|A 'choice', an actual, real 'choice', not like Angrim. And, so I'm here. And, so, now you've found me...And, so...what happens now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001072|The Clerics saw I was a prisoner and gave me a choice - fight, leave and be free, or come and join them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001071|As we left Goliet, we ran into a group of Clerics. The guards, the ones Angrim sent to kill me decided to pick a fight. They lost.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001070|Look around you, that should give you a clue.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001069|How did you get here from Edan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001068|Oh, I can see from that look. Angrim sent you, didn't he?|Realising, turning defensive.
INFO_IKENI7_00001067|And, who are you?|Wary
INFO_IKENI7_00001066|Are you Stormson? The Berserker?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001064|If Angrim has search parties out...Stormson might have gone to the Clerics. He was always fascinated by their technology.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00001063|Do you know where he might have fled to?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001062|May justice give you the strength for this task. Good luck to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001061|And the men he killed were no fools.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001060|All I ask for is justice. Kill this traitor and you will be rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001058|Tread carefully, Stormson knows the forest well.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001057|This isn't my fight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001056|This isn't revenge I am asking for, it's justice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001055|You think his life matters more than the Warriors who were guarding him? They were loyal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001053|He's as good as dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001052|Find someone else for your dirty work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001051|So be it. Now his crime is more than words and his sentence becomes the harsher. Let his death pay for the blood that was spilled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001050|I show mercy and good men die...|Annoyed at himself.
INFO_IKENI7_00001049|They're dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001048|What of the men who were escorting him to exile?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001047|You've seen him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001046|Stormson is still alive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001045|He might not be able to return to Goliet, but please tell him. He will always have at least one friend in Goliet.|Akira is in love with Stormson
INFO_IKENI7_00001044|Please, if you hear of him, if you see him out there, warn him that Angrim will keep searching for him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001043|Then he is safe. For now. He knows those forests better than anyone.|Relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00001042|Stormson escaped the guards taking him into exile.|If Stormson has escaped.
INFO_IKENI7_00001040|Please, you must go after him. Please. Convince his guards he's not a threat. Tell them to let him go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001039|Without a trial? What did he do to deserve exile?|Desperate
INFO_IKENI7_00001038|Angrim exiled Stormson to the Valley of Damned.|If the player has learned of Stormson's exile.
INFO_IKENI7_00001037|A lenient sentence, to send him back to the place he loves.|Persuading the player of their leniency
INFO_IKENI7_00001036|He has been exiled to the Valley.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001035|Stormson knew that and he made his choice. Now, the Law has been served.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001034|The Law is clear, such weapons are forbidden.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001032|So, he's still alive?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001031|He had only spoken against our ways, he was yet to break the Law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001030|You think our laws are that harsh?|Answering 'was he executed'. Surprised at the accusation
INFO_IKENI7_00001029|To prove his theory. But, his intentions are of no concern.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001028|What did he want weapons for?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001027|He went a little further than that. He was actively seeking to buy forbidden technology. Weapons from the Clerics.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001026|Speaking is a crime?|Option B
INFO_IKENI7_00001025|You had Stormson executed?|Option A
INFO_IKENI7_00001024|There was no doubting his guilt. He had spoken his thoughts quite freely and admitted that he was planning to break the Law.|Certain
INFO_IKENI7_00001023|He was arrested, questioned and sentenced.|Neutral
INFO_IKENI7_00001022|Do you know what happened to him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001021|And what business is Stormson of yours?|Business like
INFO_IKENI7_00001020|He was taken from the tavern, Oran refuses to say who took him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001019|Stormson? The hunter?|Confirming the name
INFO_IKENI7_00001018|What do you know about Stormson's disappearance?|If the player has started Akira's Quest
INFO_IKENI7_00001017|These Berserkers were killed with energy weapons. This looks like the work of Clerics...|Talking to himself, observing.
INFO_IKENI7_00001015|With magic, with self-belief and hard steel, we have returned as many dead Albs to Xacor as they have left Berserkers dead and dying here. |
INFO_IKENI7_00001014|No, I haven't seen him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001013|Are you certain? He's a hunter. About your height? Maybe you saw him in the tavern? He likes to talk to incomers.|Concerned, still hoping for help
INFO_IKENI7_00001012|Maybe, and maybe he asked the wrong person.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001011|I don't know. He asked me to go with him, to look for supplies, I assumed he meant medical supplies, but...Do you think because I said I wouldn't that he asked someone else to go with him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001010|Change what? Change how?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001007|Stormson spoke out against the Law. He thought we were losing the war, that we needed to change what we were doing if we were going to stand up to the Albs.|Sad, considering
INFO_IKENI7_00001006|Can you think why Angrim would have Stormson arrested?|
INFO_IKENI7_00001005|I can take care of myself.|Response to 'be careful.
INFO_IKENI7_00001004|Be careful. Angrim believes in the Law more than he does in people. If he thinks the Laws have been broken, he won't like anyone questioning him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001003|Okay, I'll speak to Angrim.|
INFO_IKENI7_00001002|Would you speak to Angrim? He must know what's happened.|Appealing to the player
INFO_IKENI7_00001001|If he's alive, I will find Stormson for you.|Option for the player to help
INFO_IKENI7_00001000|Stormson must have been arrested.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000999|Angrim. He is the only one who could scare Oran into staying silent about something.|Puzzled then realising.
INFO_IKENI7_00000998|Maybe he was told not to.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000997|But, if they were from Goliet, then why didn't Oran say who they were?|Worried, puzzled
INFO_IKENI7_00000996|Then the men were Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000995|That won't be easy if he's scared. Do you think this could have been someone from outside Goliet?|Apologetic
INFO_IKENI7_00000994|I'd've heard if there were more outsiders here. Everyone talks about incomers and Oran would've said something for sure.|Reply to 'could the men have been outsiders'
INFO_IKENI7_00000993|I have to find those men. Oran...I'll have to make him tell me what really happened.|Worried.
INFO_IKENI7_00000989|What are you talking about? If something's happened then I need to find out what.|Worried, upset. Responding to player saying 'give up'
INFO_IKENI7_00000988|If Oran was told to keep quiet then Stormson is probably gone for good. You should forget him.|Option 1.2 - Firm warning (Plays if Angrim has spoken to the player character)
INFO_IKENI7_00000987|Could Stormson have left with outsiders?|Option 1.1
INFO_IKENI7_00000986|He was really evasive. And it's not as if he wouldn't know, Oran knows everyone in Goliet.|Recalling the conversation..
INFO_IKENI7_00000985|Which is strange.|Beginning to sense something odd
INFO_IKENI7_00000984|Oran didn't say.|Recalling,.
INFO_IKENI7_00000983|Who did he leave with?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000982|He was supposed to meet me, but Oran said he'd left with two guys just before I got there. I haven't been able to find him since.|Both options lead to this line – Concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00000981|No, I don't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000980|Do you know where he is now?|Relieved, answer to yes.
INFO_IKENI7_00000979|Yes, I met him.|If the player has spoken to Stormson
INFO_IKENI7_00000978|Stormson? Never heard of him.|If the player hasn't spoken to Stormson.
INFO_IKENI7_00000977|Excuse me. Do you know Stormson? Have you seen him anywhere?|Hesitant to ask – approaching the player for help when the quest is active.
INFO_IKENI7_00000976|The world is changing. We must all see that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000974|These Albs will be in for a shock and once the way is shown, all Berserkers will follow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000973|A fair chance to turn the battle.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000972|I'm talking about the safety of Goliet and all who live here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000971|I'm talking about the future of Magalan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000970|What are you talking about?|The player character has no idea what Stormson is talking about
INFO_IKENI7_00000968|Today is the day when a chance was taken, that the door to victory was opened.|Unable to contain himself.
INFO_IKENI7_00000967|Today is the day things change, my friend.|Exultant, he thinks his plans are coming together.
INFO_IKENI7_00000966|If we've crossed the line and are prepared to kill a man, why question the way he was killed? Better to give up some of our principles than ask our Warriors to give up their lives.|Annoyed
INFO_IKENI7_00000965|In a fair fight. Not with swords and superstition against energy weapons.|Defensive, concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00000964|And, how do you want to win?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000963|Why does it matter how we win it? It's winning and choosing what we do afterwards that counts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000962|We are the guardians of Magalan, it is our duty to win this war.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000961|You've seen the enemy. Alb raiders? Cleric mechs? Guns?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000957|Why do you think you're losing the war?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000955|If you decide to stay here, incomer, you'll have to keep your views out there. I think Goliet's walls have narrowed the opinions of everyone who lives here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000954|It's not like there isn't a solution out there, a way we can win. But, people stick to their old ways and new thinking be damned.|Bitter
INFO_IKENI7_00000953|So, why won't anyone do anything about it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000952|Our enemies can see it. We can see it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000951|We're losing this war.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000950|No, but if something is so obvious why can't people see it?|Wound, up, venting emotion.
INFO_IKENI7_00000949|You think everyone should think the same way?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000948|How can they stare at the same thing as you and yet see something so differently?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000947|Why are people so blind?|Upset after his conversation with akira
INFO_IKENI7_00000946|Incomer. It would be good to talk later and hear your news.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000945|Sure, I can be in the tavern later. And, I'll be buying.|Doubletalk, hoping to buy a weapon from Jora.
INFO_IKENI7_00000944|It's an interesting idea. Say, why not meet me in the tavern later. I'll talk to you about it.|Laying it on then opening the door to a deal.
INFO_IKENI7_00000943|You mean give Elex weapons to someone to see if they work? Someone like you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000942|And, would you ever think of testing it in the field?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000941|Do you destroy everything that comes to you? Or, do you ever try any of it out?|Fishing
INFO_IKENI7_00000940|Why? Have you found something while you were out hunting?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000939|So, you're responsible for all the Elex technology in Goliet?|Fishing
INFO_IKENI7_00000938|What's that to a Hunter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000937|You're responsible for overseeing the Pit aren't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000936|I'm going. I'm going.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000935|I don't know who told you what, but get lost before you get me exiled, or worse...|Quieter
INFO_IKENI7_00000934|I'm sorry, stranger, I've no idea what you're talking about. Trade? Me? I'm a solid, honest, Berserker!|Loud, acting a role
INFO_IKENI7_00000933|Keep your voice down.|Quiet, but insistent
INFO_IKENI7_00000932|Are you insane? I don't know this man, I've never met him!|Loud
INFO_IKENI7_00000931|I'm not here from Angrim. I need to buy a laser weapon, the sort the Clerics use.|Quiet, but insistent
INFO_IKENI7_00000930|Did Angrim send you? Look, I don't know where he gets these ideas about me.|Defensive, concerned
INFO_IKENI7_00000929|I've heard you're the person to talk to when you need something hard to get hold of.|Conversational, playing it straight
INFO_IKENI7_00000928|And, what brings you to me?|Acting innocent, unauthorised trading is illegal
INFO_IKENI7_00000927|I'm looking to make a trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000926|You patch them up, I want to give people a chance to fight back. If I can pull this off, you will have fewer wounded to worry about.|As he leaves
INFO_IKENI7_00000925|But, what can be done that the Warlords haven't done already?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000922|Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000921|It is criminal that we hadn't helped him before.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000920|The work Irdor does is at the heart, the World Heart, of everything we stand for.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000919|None to speak of.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000918|Were there any problems?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000916|You have proved yourself a friend to the Berserkers with this act.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000915|I took care of Irdor.|Reporting back after taking Irdor the medicine
INFO_IKENI7_00000914|Everyone here will appreciate it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000913|Thank you again, you've done us a real favor.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000912|Well, good, here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000911|That will do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000910|Well, I don't have that much. This will have to cover it I'm afraid.|Reluctant
INFO_IKENI7_00000909|Yes, that is a fair amount.|humane minus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00000908|No. You must pay twice that.|plus one cold
INFO_IKENI7_00000907|And, I'm trying to help them all. Fine, you think they'll eat moldy bread then feed it to them, that's up to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000906|He said they were desperate. I'm trying to help a Berserker here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000905|You could. If you think they'll eat it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000904|I found it. I can take that to Irdor and the Cultivators.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000903|I can't leave, Stormson, Caldrim is counting on me. And, there are so many wounded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000902|Nothing we can do will end this war.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000901|We can take a risk. Isn't it more important that we win this war, rather than how we win it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000900|Someone has to do something. Doing the same thing again and again, it's insane!|
INFO_IKENI7_00000899|That's more of a reason. If we keep doing the same things, this war won't end.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000898|With all the wounded there are these days? We can hardly keep up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000897|You should come with me. See something more than Goliet.|Arguing, Stormson is set on his idea, Akira is tied to her duty
INFO_IKENI7_00000896|Elex technology is forbidden, by law it must remain in the Pit!|
INFO_IKENI7_00000895|Return to Angrim. It's his test, it's for him to explain everything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000894|You mean I should've disobeyed his request?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000892|And, that is the lesson. We all have our freewill, and we must all choose how we use it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000890|You didn't say I shouldn't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000889|I did. But, I didn't say you should take it.|Agreeing, but pointing out the logic
INFO_IKENI7_00000888|You told me where I could find the weapon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000887|What reason would I have to deny him?|Neutral
INFO_IKENI7_00000886|Orders are orders.|Neutral
INFO_IKENI7_00000885|If Angrim sent you, why wouldn't I?|Neutral
INFO_IKENI7_00000884|Are you allowed to give it to me?|Suspicious, stress on you.
INFO_IKENI7_00000882|You know your instructions. You know where the weapon is.|Neutral
INFO_IKENI7_00000881|And, I can take it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000880|I have it in my house. It is awaiting processing at the Pit. If you want it, you will find it there.|Neutral
INFO_IKENI7_00000879|Yes, where is it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000878|And, you will be cursed if you stay here too.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000876|Be you a drifter looking to earn your keep, or someone wishing to join the Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000874|That would be near the Mana shrine. If you wish to find something in Goliet, take your feet out of the door and find someone else to be your tour guide.|Dismissive
INFO_IKENI7_00000872|And he is, just with more of a sense of humor. In their hour of need the Berserkers call for another Eisenfaust and, in Ragnar, I believe they have him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000871|When he was a child, Ragnar met Eisenfaust and I think that left its mark. He wanted to be that man.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000870|He was seen defending the Seedlings from mutants and was named Warrior on the spot.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000869|He was named Berserker when he was a teen. Served his time in the fields as a Cultivator.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000868|No, I'm afraid it's a tale of skill, ability and dedication.|Playfully over dramatic
INFO_IKENI7_00000867|Do you mean is there a deep dark secret? A tale of rivalry and assassination to rise to the top?|Playfully over dramatic
INFO_IKENI7_00000865|Tell me the real story.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000864|Hard work, dedication and popularity.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000863|How did Ragnar become Warlord?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000861|A farm, on the border with Abessa.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000860|Where are you from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000859|Until this is all sorted out, I've got to put my supplies where they'll do the most good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000858|But, honestly, I can set up four other supply runs to other people in the time I can get someone to him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000857|I'll get someone out there with better supplies when I can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000856|For now.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000855|Is moldy bread all there is?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000853|You are a born gatherer!|
INFO_IKENI7_00000852|I have brought you the Cultivator's loaf.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000851|Here, that should pay for it, right?|Paying the player
INFO_IKENI7_00000850|That should see our stomachs full. Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000849|Yet here I am and here are your supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000848|You stole it? That was a risk! You could've been exiled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000847|I took it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000846|Oh, well. About time we got a break.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000845|She said I could take it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000844|Sinda gave it to me.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000842|I normally get hard biscuits.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000841|Wow, you must've sweet talked her.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000840|I brought you some bread.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000839|You have? Oh, I'm salivating already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000838|I have brought supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000836|Can we trade?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000835|For the want of a few men, we waste resources that we're already short of.|Stress on waste
INFO_IKENI7_00000834|I mean, what use is moldy bread?|Angered
INFO_IKENI7_00000833|Except for a load of bread I had to throw out, because no one picked it up from the baker until it was too late. |
INFO_IKENI7_00000832|Everything I've got here has already been assigned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000831|You can purchase what you want.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000828|Then he's not much of a Cultivator is he?|Snapping
INFO_IKENI7_00000827|If you don't help him he will die.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000826|What if I buy them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000825|I'm not responsible for your promises. I have a whole town to feed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000824|I promised I'd get him supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000823|But, he will have to wait. He can forage in the forest, the people here can't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000822|Yes, I suppose he's not had any supplies for a while.|Recalling
INFO_IKENI7_00000821|Irdor? The Cultivator?|Trying to remember Irdor
INFO_IKENI7_00000820|Irdor needs supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000819|Of course, if we weren't besieged by Outlaws, Albs and worse still pen-pushing bureaucrats, I could offer you more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000818|You can take a look at our stock.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000816|What do you have to trade?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000815|Because, unless we get help I don't know how we keep feeding the people we've already got here.|Winding herself up
INFO_IKENI7_00000814|Are you here to trade, fight, or just add another mouth to the masses?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000812|Another incomer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000810|I don't know. They found the first one, the first Berserkers, they realized what it could do, that it fed on Elex rather than dying from it. So, they started cultivating them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000809|So where do the World Hearts come from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000808|The more we plant, the more of Magalan is restored.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000807|It makes the soil come back to life, let's Magalan's nature return to it. So, wherever we plant a World Heart, life follows.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000806|Wherever you plant a World Heart it extracts the Elex from the ground, pulls the poison out of the soil.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000805|We're changing the world with them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000804|So, tell me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000803|You don't understand much about our ways do you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000802|Why plant the World Heart out here where it's in danger?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000801|Say, let's round it up. Can you bring me 50?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000800|Yes, hopefully, that would last us until we get another supply run..|
INFO_IKENI7_00000799|Four dozen?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000798|It grows everywhere, but we've just not had time to collect them. Four dozen should be enough.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000797|Listen, Goliet aside, there's a plant, the Cultivator's Loaf. If you could collect some of that, It would help us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000796|Our stomachs have better memories than they have.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000795|At some point. When they remember. Trust me, you going and asking will be faster than us waiting for them to remember.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000794|I can't farm, fight and bring in supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000793|Please, just don't forget.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000792|I'll see what I can do.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000791|Won't they send you supplies?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000790|Just the usual supply run. Or, just, well, anything to be honest. We're hungry out here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000789|I'm not asking for anything special.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000788|Sinda is probably the best person to ask. She's fierce, I mean ball shriveling fierce, but gets things done.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000787|Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000786|I will ask about your food supplies.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000785|We are supposed to be self-sufficient out here, but with more Alb attacks and more creatures, we don't have time to grow, forage, or hunt anymore.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000784|The Alb attacks. The Warlords've put all the Warriors on defense and cut down on the supply runs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000783|Why have the deliveries come to a halt?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000782|But, you can't rely on that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000781|Directly from Goliet, normally. Sometimes, we will get something from passing hunters.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000780|Where do you get your supplies from?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000779|Can you get them to send someone with my food supplies?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000778|I've not had any supplies from Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000777|But, if you're offering to help there is one thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000776|Happy? I don't know. I'm not dead.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00000775|So, you're happy out here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000774|Yeah, can you tell him about the World Heart? That it's okay? He should know we're still working, even though the patrols aren't coming to check.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000773|Anything you want me to report to Ragnar?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000772|Still, all in a day's work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000770|That is, if the animals don't get me first. Or, I don't eat the wrong thing and get poisoned.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000769|They don't seem to register it. The World Heart mustn't be their mission, or they don't know about it. They'd kill me fast enough though.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000768|You mean with the Albs scouting out Goliet?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000767|How safe is the World Heart here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000766|Now, I get a kick from seeing just a few Seedlings a season make it all the way to mature.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000765|Beer, women and fights were all that used to matter.|Reflecting on how he's changed.
INFO_IKENI7_00000764|Yeah. Masochist aren't I?|With a laugh, self-deprecating.
INFO_IKENI7_00000763|Punished? And you say you enjoy doing this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000762|I got sent here as punishment five years ago.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000761|Oh, I didn't want to do it. This was a sentence.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000760|Anyone can stick a sword in someone. But, farming, growing, cultivating, bringing life, that takes skill.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000758|Say that next time you eat stew, or need a healing plant.|Used to this
INFO_IKENI7_00000757|How long have you been doing this?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000756|Changing the world? You just put plants in dirt.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000755|Warriors might get the glory, but it's us Cultivators who are changing the world.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000754|The Warriors act like they're the big guys, but really they are here to protect us.|Stressing the importance of Cultivators
INFO_IKENI7_00000753|We grow the crops for Goliet and we tend to the Seedlings and the World Hearts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000752|We're farmers, in the main.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000751|What is a Cultivator?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000750|Maybe, that's what Born meant, he told me being a Cultivator was about learning who you are. Out here, isolated, with this to care about... I have certainly gained perspective.|Realising he has changed.
INFO_IKENI7_00000749|But, yes...what are we next to a World Heart? Ants in history...Here we are standing by the future of Magalan, the very thing given to us in Magalan's hour of need. |His militancy cooling
INFO_IKENI7_00000748|That's what you care about? The World Heart? What about the men sent with it? If we wither, it does too. Goliet should care as much about us as they care about that plant.|Aggrieved
INFO_IKENI7_00000747|Are you responsible for the World Heart here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000746|What brings you all the way out here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000745|Which are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000744|Yeah? Normally the only people to come out here are Albs, or Outlaws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000743|What are you doing here? No one's allowed round the World Heart.|Jumpy
INFO_IKENI7_00000741|So you say.|Slightly more trusting, but still a little nervous
INFO_IKENI7_00000740|I'm no threat.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000739|You seem nervous.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000737|Who are you?|Jumpy, only moderate projection this is in conversation camera

INFO_IKENI7_00000729|Why would I marry someone whose expression is that of thunder over the mountains?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000728|You're married?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000727|Ragnar the Fierce? Ragnar, son of Bjar? He is warlord of the Hooded Crows. Warlord, warrior, leader. And my husband.|Grandiose then back to earth for husband.
INFO_IKENI7_00000726|Tell me about Ragnar.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000725|As you can see, there's always something to do here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000724|Oh, and Irdor hasn't sent back any reports from the World Heart lately. Find out if he's all right and if he needs anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000723|The Cultivators are constantly bothering me with their requests. That needs to stop.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000722|Since I can't pass off my duties onto you, you will have to make yourself useful in another way.|Thinking things through, mental list.
INFO_IKENI7_00000721|You seem to take this seriously, that's good.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000720|Is there anything else that I can do for you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000718|Lend them a hand and uphold our rules.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000717|Some are overburdened or are doing things that are not in line with the Law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000716|Help the people here and they will give a good report of you to the Warlord of their clan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000715|Ask around the city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000714|What do I need to do?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000710|I am ready to join the Berserkers.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000708|Here. You have done good service and shall have what you desire in return.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000707|You could pay more.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000706|You will get paid for the tasks you're given.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000705|Then you will pay me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000703|Nor should you. A man must know his value.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000702|I don't work for free.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000701|About my support ...|
INFO_IKENI7_00000700|Speak to the people here and they can tell you where your skills are best used. Earn their trust and you may earn mine.|to business,
INFO_IKENI7_00000699|Food, medicine, machine parts and other equipment. There are too few Cultivators in the fields...|
INFO_IKENI7_00000696|Slow down, friend. First prove to me that you would be a good Cultivator.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000691|Where can I buy armor like yours?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000689|There are many things to be done. Our people are dedicated, but we still have supply shortages.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000688|Yes.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000685|But it also takes guts to confront me. Hm, so you really want to help us out?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000682|I'm guessing wherever you came from sees conditions far worse than you'll find here, despite the attacks we are suffering. Bear that in mind before you criticize.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000679|Yes, it's apparent.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000677|Because I see what is going on here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000676|Special tasks? Why would you figure that I need someone who can do more than just the usual?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000675|What kind of special tasks would you have for me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000673|Yes?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000668|Where is the Warrior Quarter?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000667|Look for him in the Warrior's Quarter, near the Mana shrine.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000666|Where can I find Angrim?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000665|And, we have something to fight for.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000658|Do you think the Berserkers can stop the Albs from conquering Edan?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000644|And take this to help you remember this - If anyone asks, 'I never heard of any weapons', right?|Handing over Elexit
INFO_IKENI7_00000643|My advice, get rid of that stuff as fast as you can.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000642|You get caught with those, you can dig your own grave. And a grave for anyone connected to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000641|That's way too hot for me to handle!|
INFO_IKENI7_00000640|Are you crazy?|Genuinely worried
INFO_IKENI7_00000639|Want to buy some Cleric's weapons?|Option 4.7
INFO_IKENI7_00000638|Those are my thoughts and there are some here that share them.|Conversational, avoiding getting too heavy with the player.
INFO_IKENI7_00000636|Say, you look like you could do with something to eat. Take this, as a gift.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000635|And, whatever you want to buy, you'll need to find the shards to pay.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000634|You'll need to look elsewhere if you want energy weapons, or anything more advanced than a hand sharpened stick.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000633|That depends what you want to buy.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000632|So, is there anywhere to trade here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000631|But, it's not exactly civilization is it?|The people work well, but where's the technology?
INFO_IKENI7_00000630|Goliet is civilized.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000629|Sore backs, blistered hands, slow progress.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000628|Look at the people here. They want to change the world. But, they're doing it one handful of soil at a time.|The people here have a laudable idea, but are doing things the wrong way.
INFO_IKENI7_00000627|You don't think technology should be forbidden?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000624|But protection came at a price. My safety for a law that is more limiting than freeing. They reject all technology. Can you imagine that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000622|I came here when the Albs raided the farm, the Berserkers found me and brought me here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000620|But, some of the other factions use plasma weapons. What good is a club going to be against those?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000618|Well, they're a fierce bunch and the walls are better than where I was.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000617|You don't feel safe here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000615|But, I wish I had more than this simple weapon to defend myself with. This doesn't exactly make me feel safe.|Starting his pitch to test the player's interest in being a Cleric
INFO_IKENI7_00000613|I was pretty badly injured when I was brought here. They took me in and patched me up.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000611|There are just too many raiding parties out there now. If you don't belong to a faction, well, you're just counting the days until you're dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000610|Oh, I only arrived here recently myself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000609|Is it that obvious?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000608|Hey, incomer. You are new here, right?|

INFO_IKENI7_00000597|Why would Rijka help you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000596|I'm sure she will help me.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000589|Then I am a dead man.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000588|Angrim knows about you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000587|Don't thank me. All life is sacred, but...this was a betrayal. By him and by me...|Sad, disappointed
INFO_IKENI7_00000586|Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000585|I've taken care of it. Bertram will be added to the list of guards. They'll leave shortly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000584|Wait here a moment.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000579|Well, you have risked yourself for us, so I suppose I owe you for that...|Reluctant.
INFO_IKENI7_00000578|Listen, you must act quickly, or Bertram will be killed. He is from the Free People and he is asking for your help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000577|He knew that, when he took the risk to come here and preach against us. And, he lied to me. .|

INFO_IKENI7_00000553|Probably, probably. If there was. If you could prove it.|Wary, still avoiding admitting he is a Cleric.

INFO_IKENI7_00000551|The Berserkers know there's a Cleric in Goliet. Angrim sent me here to find you.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000548|You are a Cleric.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000547|What? Why would I want them? What are you accusing me of? |Protesting.
INFO_IKENI7_00000546|Drop the act. I know you're here for the Clerics' weapons.|Direct
INFO_IKENI7_00000545|You think someone wants to do that? That would be crazy. Suicidal.|Innocent

INFO_IKENI7_00000538|Lies only truly convince liars. I'll have no part in that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000537|Plant some Cleric's equipment in his hut. That would persuade people.|option A

INFO_IKENI7_00000527|I can find whoever is preaching here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000526|And such is the lure of machines that I've let it be known that we've captured some of the Clerics technology.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000525|If you can't find him before midnight, then I would suggest you go to the Pit around then. Let's see if this rat comes out to steal from us.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000507|You think it's wrong to forbid technology?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000506|If you've come from beyond the walls, it won't be anything new to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000504|The regular kind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000503|Friends? You mean you're a Cleric, or you know someone who is.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000502|That sort of accusation can get someone killed. So, don't go shouting that at me. I'm no use to you dead. Besides, you can do with a friend. And the shards they bring.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000501|I'm sure they would be grateful for your help. You'd be making some useful friends.|Hinting on friends - Bertram is a Cleric, but must hide this for fear of reprisals
INFO_IKENI7_00000500|I just know some interested parties who would like to get hold of those weapons.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000498|Are you some sort of trader?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000497|May Calaan forgive you for giving those weapons back to these barbarians.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000496|You're a Cleric. You're supposed to understand these things.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000495|Go. Hand them in. A shame, I thought you would be clearer thinking than the others here.|Disappointed

INFO_IKENI7_00000491|Sell? No, think of this as a finder's fee.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000490|I'll sell the weapons to you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000489|No, your Elexit isn't worth the risk.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000487|Of course, of course, I can offer you Elexit if you give them to me. That would only be fair.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000486|If that's your duty, they should. If you really think such technology should just be thrown away, you right give them to Jora.|Diplomatic persuasion, still hoping for the weapons.
INFO_IKENI7_00000485|They're forbidden here. They must go to Jora at the Pit. We can't risk them falling into the hands of the Clerics.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000483|I can't give you the weapons.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000481|So, have you given those weapons over to the Pit, or do you still have them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000480|This is a small town with lots of big mouths. There aren't really that many secrets.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000479|Is that an accusation?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000478|For both of us.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000477|That would be good. |
INFO_IKENI7_00000476|Listen, what I need is some help. Let's be straight, you recently tracked down a pair of Cleric weapons, didn't you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000475|Yes, of course, Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000474|Be careful. You know I could get you exiled for even asking about that?|Humane, Cold-1
INFO_IKENI7_00000473|And, if I did know something about them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000472|I'd be interested in getting a look at them, if you know how I could get a chance to do that?|

INFO_IKENI7_00000453|Thank you. The sooner we can put them into the right hands, the better.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000440|Have you take the Clerics' weapons to Jora?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000439|The area is quieter now, but Ragnar has had to assign the Warriors from the patrol to other tasks. That's why I hope you can go.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000438|The Clerics seem to have stirred them up and had half the mutants in the area after them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000437|There were too many mutants.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000435|The Clerics came off worse.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000422|Good, good. I would wish that for you.|Pleased

INFO_IKENI7_00000406|Not everyone here is as welcoming as they could be.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000398|Hello.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000397|This damned Cleric must be found and stopped.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000396|Even now I know there is someone here in Goliet spreading the lie of the machine. They are preaching that technology will be our salvation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000395|We might know technology is a weakness, but its draw is pulling in recruits.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000394|It's persuading the weak-minded of that.|Both 34 and 35 lead into this part
INFO_IKENI7_00000393|Technology is an addiction. First one machine then another and another. It is better to live without that temptation.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000392|Strength, belief and Mana will always overcome steel.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000391|Our magic is more than a match for their machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000390|How can you fight their guns with swords?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000389|Can't you use technology to help nature?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000388|Whatever you think of the Outlaws, they make no excuses for their behavior. They are out for themselves, but they believe in mankind.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000387|Elex corrupts all it touches.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000386|And never forget that their blessed religion gave birth to the Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000385|The Clerics speak of god, but they worship their machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000384|What are we supposed to think? They're steeped in blood and governed by superstition!|
INFO_IKENI7_00000383|What do you think about the Clerics, or the Albs?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000382|I'd start your search at the huts the exiles have built out in the forest. Maybe someone there has seen him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000381|He was going to find shelter then carry out reconnaissance. There had been reports of Albs in that area.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000380|He had entered the Valley of the Damned when we last heard from him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000379|Where should I search for Rogar?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000377|Sir.|In deferrence
INFO_IKENI7_00000376|Thank you, Jora. You may return to your duties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000375|We are twice blessed by the Pilgrim this day.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000374|As long as you prove to be honest in the future.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000373|It seemed you listened. And, so I say, go back empty handed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000371|A rare quality that should be rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000370|You have shown insight.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000369|Most people complete their tasks without thinking.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000368|You have. I am impressed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000367|Jora said I passed the test.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000366|If you break our Laws for reward, or favor, you will be punished. If you listen to the Laws and keep them, you will be rewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000365|Angrim will give you a reward for doing so.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000364|It seemed you listened and have learned our Law. Go back empty handed.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000363|They are, they are forbidden to all Berserkers. Angrim's task was a test. He only trusts those who question their orders according to the Law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000362|Angrim only trusts those who question their orders according to the Law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000361|A game? No. A test. Elex weapons are forbidden here in Goliet, but there are those who think orders and duty are above the law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000360|Are you playing some sort of a game with me?|humane cold minus one
INFO_IKENI7_00000359|Elex weapons are forbidden in Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000357|And, you want me to give you this weapon do you?|Cautious. He knows Angrim's request is a test for the player
INFO_IKENI7_00000356|Yes, he said it was captured from the Clerics. He wants to study it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000354|He did, did he?|Cautious
INFO_IKENI7_00000353|Angrim sent me to collect an Elex weapon from you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000352|That is my judgement. Justice will be seen. Justice will be served.|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00000351|And you, stranger, are a guest in our city.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000350|I am Angrim. Keeper of our Law and Warlord of the Eisen clan.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000349|Who are you to judge me?|If the player has stolen the weapon, but not met Angrim before
INFO_IKENI7_00000347|Our laws are clear. Any Elex technology should be given to the Pit and stay there. You have broken this Law.|The player has stolen the weapon.
INFO_IKENI7_00000345|Here, your deed should not go unrewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000344|Then Rogar can rest in peace. You have done a good thing.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000343|The Albs who killed Rogar are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000342|Your good deed should not go unrewarded.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000341|Then Rogar can rest in peace.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000340|The Albs are dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000339|It is now. Find them, bring them to justice and you will be rewarded.|Hoping to persuade the player to kill the Albs.
INFO_IKENI7_00000338|This is nothing to do with me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000337|Or, have they already paid for this in blood?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000336|Do you know where these Albs are?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000335|Then he was right, they will stop at nothing to take this land.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000334|He was targeted by a group of Albs.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000333|I feared the worst. How did he die?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000332|Rogar is dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000331|But, if you intend to spend time here in Goliet, learn our laws. I won't be so forgiving next time.|Stern, formal
INFO_IKENI7_00000330|Find a Berserker called Rogar in the Valley of the Damned and penance will be paid. |
INFO_IKENI7_00000329|My judgement should be to send you into exile.|Considering the player
INFO_IKENI7_00000328|You have broken our Laws. But, on this occasion, I will give you a chance to redeem yourself.|Stern, then offering a way out
INFO_IKENI7_00000327|Self-destructive.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000326|Screw you. How's that for breath?|Defiant
INFO_IKENI7_00000325|The world is full of people who treat words as breath. If you join us here, your words must be trusted. Your actions must show us who you are.|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00000324|I also told you to follow our laws to the letter.|Angrim told him the laws and the quest
INFO_IKENI7_00000323|You sent me to get that Elex weapon.|In his defence
INFO_IKENI7_00000322|Do you have anything to say in your defense?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000321|So, you have broken our laws.|Angrim starts with this line the conversation if the player has stolen the weapon before the quest starts.
INFO_IKENI7_00000320|The Law has been broken and he will decide your fate.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000319|Then you can argue that out with Angrim.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000318|Well, he didn't.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000317|If he instructed you to come here then he would certainly have told you the Laws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000316|He didn't tell me any Laws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000315|Follow me. And, let us hope, for your sake, that he grants you clemency.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000314|And, the theft of Elex carries a heavy penalty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000313|I'm afraid you just failed that test.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000312|He told you the Laws then set you a test to see if you had listened.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000311|What are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000310|He was testing you.|Revealing the quest
INFO_IKENI7_00000309|And, did he also tell you our Laws?|Prompting
INFO_IKENI7_00000308|Tell that to Angrim, he sent me here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000307|Our laws are clear, any Elex technology should be given over to the Pit and it stays there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000306|I'm not stealing anything.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000305|Stop thief! You think you're going to get away with stealing from here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000303|Well, if it's just business, here's some Elexit. And nothing says 'I love you' better than that.|Banter, joke, he doesn't love the player!
INFO_IKENI7_00000302|A trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000301|Is this a trade, or the opening to a romantic advance?|Deliberately misunderstanding.
INFO_IKENI7_00000300|I have some machine parts? Interested?|Option 4.4 Cautious, quiet
INFO_IKENI7_00000299|Not right now..|
INFO_IKENI7_00000298|Anything else you're looking for?|Option4.8
INFO_IKENI7_00000297|Oh, well, life is just one long series of opportunities. We'll make a profit next time.|You lose one, you win another.
INFO_IKENI7_00000296|Someone else got the machine parts you wanted.|If the machine parts are gone
INFO_IKENI7_00000295|Oh, well, that's a shame. Still, one door closes, another deal opens. There are always more places for a profit.|2
INFO_IKENI7_00000294|Born already has the healing roots.|1 This line comes if the player has already given the roots to Born
INFO_IKENI7_00000293|Well, truth be told, Jora really doesn't like the stuff. And I know people who love it! So, it would be winners all round.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000292|You want me to bring you things with Elex in them?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000291|So, how about you help collect that stuff for him then accidentally 'lose' it on the way back?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000290|Well, Jora, the guy in charge there needs help collecting things with Elex in them. And here's you looking to be helpful.|Both lead to this line
INFO_IKENI7_00000289|Oh, it's a storage place. They keep unwanted items there.|Innocently understating. . .
INFO_IKENI7_00000288|What's the Pit?|If he doesn't
INFO_IKENI7_00000287|Yes.|If he knows him
INFO_IKENI7_00000286|Well, there is something that needs acquiring and redistributing. You know the Pit, right?|1
INFO_IKENI7_00000285|Do you need any other items?|1 Option 4.3
INFO_IKENI7_00000284|Take your payment then, but remember there is more to this life than Elexit can buy. Loyalty and duty are worth more than shards.|Payment - the money the player has already got for selling the parts. Sage warning.
INFO_IKENI7_00000283|Yours was the risk and so yours was the profit?|Guessing at the player's motive for selling.
INFO_IKENI7_00000281|You sold them?|Guessing, disappointed.
INFO_IKENI7_00000280|I got a better offer.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000279|Why is that?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000278|And, yet you haven't brought them to me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000277|It's good you were able to help him. He's...a little eccentric, but he's a good man. Maybe, this will help sort him out.|Pleased about Korin and the quest
INFO_IKENI7_00000276|Good, I honestly thought Korin had been killed, or I'd've sent men to find him.|Relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00000275|He was trapped by mutants, but I helped him escape. He'll bring the parts to you himself.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000274|Korin's alive?|Surprised
INFO_IKENI7_00000273|But, I gave them to Korin.|humane cold minus one
INFO_IKENI7_00000272|Yes, I got them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000271|Hey, so did you get the Converter parts?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000270|Just remember our Laws. Follow them to the letter and you will earn my trust.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000269|Trust is earned, incomer. Do as I ask and opportunities will follow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000268|Follow the Law and do service, those are the only ways you will earn my trust.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000267|I'll get you the weapon.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000266|I'm not a collection service.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000265|Bring me one of the Elex weapons.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000264|All the captured weaponry from the last Alb attack has been stored there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000263|Visit Jora at the Pit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000262|I agree to follow the Laws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000261|Peace always comes at a price.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000260|Our Laws preserve us and so we must preserve the Law.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000259|None of these wars were started by Berserkers. There are always those who want to take, or destroy. So, we must defend what we believe in.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000258|Warlords? I thought you wanted peace?|Surprised at the term
INFO_IKENI7_00000257|One of the Warlords, or all three of us. I hope you don't have cause to find out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000256|Who decides the punishment?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000255|I was told there was work here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000254|Break one of the Five Laws and justice may be harsher.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000253|The Warlords will hear evidence and pronounce sentence. Trade without a license, steal, or cheat and exile will follow.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000252|What happens when the Law is broken?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000251|The fourth Law says Mana must be preserved. Nature can purify Elex, this has given us the gift of magic and we must use it sparingly.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000249|Our third Law states that World Hearts are sacred. No damage can be done to them, or their Seedlings.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000248|The second Law says pure Elex is a curse on Magalan. All pure Elex and technology made from it is forbidden and must be placed in the Pit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000247|So says the first article that forbids anyone from preaching of gods, or machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000246|Now, as a Warlord, it is my job to keep the laws in the Pilgrim's name. So, I welcome you, incomer.|

INFO_IKENI7_00000240|We don't need gods, or machines. That forest out there, that grew from wasteland in just two hundred years.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000239|Do you want to believe that? That there's a hope?|Hoping to recruit the player
INFO_IKENI7_00000238|They're everyone you've seen in this town. And anyone beyond who believes this world can be saved.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000236|Who are the Berserkers?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000235|Nature, rebuilding what was lost, that's the only way we can survive. Berserker Laws were created to help us achieve that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000233|War, chaos, Elex technology, what chances have they given us?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000231|Tell me more about these laws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000227|You will find Goliet more open than many places.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000226|Finding new recruits is part of a Warlord's duty.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000225|Would you let me stay here? And become a Berserker?|Option 1.2
INFO_IKENI7_00000224|We offer protection to those from outside who understand that Edan is working to help Magalan.|both options lead into this part
INFO_IKENI7_00000221|Who are you?|Option 1.1
INFO_IKENI7_00000220|All those things can be offered, to those who accept our laws.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000219|Safety? A new start? Meaning?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000218|What are you seeking here, stranger?|Calm, authoratative
INFO_IKENI7_00000217|Another one? I swear if security had been this lax in the days of Erik Eisenfaust, we'd all be Clerics...|With a sig
INFO_IKENI7_00000216|Maybe, my curse has been broken.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000215|Thank you, thank you, thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000214|That's exactly what Jora asked me to bring him.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000213|The Converter parts, you got them?!|Surprised, thankful,
INFO_IKENI7_00000212|Here, I found these in the Converter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000210|Every time I think I have cleared a path to search for the parts, more come.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000209|It draws the mutants to the Elex that's in there|
INFO_IKENI7_00000208|It doesn't matter if it is deactivated or not.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000207|These Converters are deadly machines.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000206|Why didn't you complete your task?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000205|Please, just hear me out.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000196|Let us finish this!|building up to a fight
INFO_IKENI7_00000195|I won't make this easy for you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000194|Just because you're an Outlaw?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000193|You're going to give them to me.|Threatening
INFO_IKENI7_00000192|What now?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000191|About these Converter parts...|
INFO_IKENI7_00000190|Hey, no! I risked my life getting them. Why should I give them to you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000189|Give me the Converter parts you've found.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000188|Since we're both here to find Converter parts ... can't you find some for me too? I only need a few more and I can go back.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000187|So, yeah, I'll pay you the few shards I have if you help me break it.|Down
INFO_IKENI7_00000186|I've been paying every day this curse has been on me.|Down
INFO_IKENI7_00000185|I'll get you Converter parts...If you pay me.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000184|I'm taking any Converter parts I find back to Jora.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000183|If I could get those Converter parts they would save me from exile. |Meaning himself
INFO_IKENI7_00000182|It is the home of the mutants, and me. Unless, I can find the rest of the Converter parts.|Damned meaning himself
INFO_IKENI7_00000181|But, then the Berserkers didn't expect mutants to move in here so quickly. Now, this place belongs to neither Alb, nor Berserker.|Irony
INFO_IKENI7_00000180|They didn't expect such a fierce attack from the Berserkers, or I suppose they would've rigged the place to self-destruct.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000179|Oh, yes. The Albs left the Converter in full working order.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000178|Did you find any Converter parts here?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000177|Wherever I go, mutants follow. Wherever I go, I fail.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000176|I watched a whole Berserker patrol ripped to pieces by them. I was the only survivor. I thought it was just dumb luck.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000172|The mutants that come to this place, they're drawn to me! That's my curse.|Warning. Sorry for himself
INFO_IKENI7_00000171|What curse? What are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000170|I'd be exiled to the Valley of the Damned in no time. I might as well stay here and keep the mutants away from others.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000169|With everything that's happened? Now, I fail another task he's given me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000168|You could tell Jora about the mutants?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000167|He doesn't know the Albs left their mutants here to tear the flesh from any who came after them.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000166|He probably thinks the Converter is empty because the Albs abandoned it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000165|But, every time I went into the Converter more mutants came.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000164|I tried.|No he didn't get the parts.
INFO_IKENI7_00000163|Jora doesn't leave Goliet often.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000162|Jora didn't mention mutants.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000161|Then you haven't found the Converter parts?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000160|He didn't? But, then it has been a long time. He must have thought me dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000159|No. Jora didn't mention you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000157|Then you were sent after me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000156|I am looking for Converter parts.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000154|I carry the curse that has tainted this place.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000153|Warn, not scare.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000151|No one and nothing. I am now the guardian of this place. And, you should go before my story becomes yours.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000150|Are you trying to scare me off?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000149|Forget this cursed place.|Calm, purposeful
INFO_IKENI7_00000148|Why ever you came, take my advice and leave.|Calm, purposeful
INFO_IKENI7_00000145|Who are you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000143|What's wrong with you?|Assessing the player, calm
INFO_IKENI7_00000141|There's nothing here for you, but misery. Be on your way!|Alert
INFO_IKENI7_00000140|Always a man to believe the worst, you know he believes he's cursed? I'll send a patrol to bring him home.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000139|He couldn't complete his task, he is terrified of being exiled.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000138|Once a man thinks he's doomed, he will find a way to bring an end upon himself. I hope his was quick.|Sad
INFO_IKENI7_00000137|Then his curse did catch up with him?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000136|Would have been difficult. He's dead.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000135|He is still alive? Oh, thank the Pilgrim. Why didn't he return to Goliet?|Surprised, thankful,
INFO_IKENI7_00000134|I found Korin there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000133|What did you find up at the Converter?|Curious
INFO_IKENI7_00000132|Oh, thank the Pilgrim! Now, we have enough Elex to can continue Mana processing.|Relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00000131|Here are the Converter parts you wanted.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000130|Last guy we sent disappeared. He promised he'd be back quickly. Never seen again.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000129|Good, great, thank you. Be careful though.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000128|I will get you the Converter parts you want.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000127|That machine is a thing abhorrent to nature, but...we can make use of it, well of the Elex in it.|Hating the word 'machine'.
INFO_IKENI7_00000126|The Albs built it to refine Elex here in Edan, but our warriors forced them to abandon it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000125|What about it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000124|You must have seen that monster made of metal that sits on the horizon? That Alb Converter.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000123|But, we must all work together to end it.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000122|I understand. There is war on.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000120|Why should I help you?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000119|You want me to collect Elex?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000118|So, we collect it, transmute it and hope we win the race against those who would use it for destruction. You could help us with that.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000116|Ah, Amrek's Paradox. We are told Elex is the center of all ills in the world, and yet it is also the cure.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000115|So, if you need Elex, why do you want to get rid of it?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000113|Once the Elex has been extracted there, it goes to the Mana shrine and the junk left over goes down into the Pit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000112|That is where we take all forbidden technology.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000111|The Pit?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000109|Such is temptation. The Albs take Elex, they get stronger, but what have they become?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000108|Surely, technology makes life easier?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000107|So, we collect technology, extract the Elex from it and throw the scrap into the Pit.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000106|A clean life. Life as it was before the Comet. Life grown from Mana. Now, that's a better use for Elex than building devices.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000105|We haven't rejected technology completely, we have rejected Elex technology. And, as you can see around you, we have done fine without it.|Proud of his town
INFO_IKENI7_00000104|How do you get anything done without technology?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000103|Others who are stricter with the Law might see chopping your arm off to keep the law as a price worth paying.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000102|Right...Well, your arm is safe from me, but don't go showing that thing around.|Wary after the aggressive response.
INFO_IKENI7_00000101|You should take it to the Pit for disposal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000098|Still, best you know that should you find any other Elex technology on your travels.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000097|Well, you don't look like an Alb...Too much color in your cheeks, too much shine in your eyes. That and you've not tried to kill me.|Curious as to why the player has Alb Tech with him
INFO_IKENI7_00000096|An implant? Well, that gives you a reason for not removing it.|Considering
INFO_IKENI7_00000094|You want to take it, you'll have to cut my arm off.|Aggressive
INFO_IKENI7_00000093|I'm not carrying it, it's an implant.|Informative
INFO_IKENI7_00000091|It's Elex technology and that sort of device is forbidden to Berserkers here in Goliet.|Both options come to here
INFO_IKENI7_00000090|Have you got a problem with me?|Aggressive
INFO_IKENI7_00000089|There, on your arm. What is that?|Stern
INFO_IKENI7_00000088|What are you talking about?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000087|Hey! What's that you're hiding there?|Authoratative challenge
INFO_IKENI7_00000085|They can be easy to overlook, so you may need to search for them a little.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000084|They grow in small clusters around the lake above Goliet.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000083|Where can I find the healing roots?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000082|Who could have done this?! Don't they realize they've put lives in danger? I'll report this to Ragnar. We will find out who is responsible.|Angered
INFO_IKENI7_00000081|Well, there weren't any healing roots there.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000080|They can't have, I told you we're short of people to do the harvesting.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000079|There weren't any. Someone must have taken them already.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000078|Ah, you have them for me?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000077|You don't need to worry about harvesting those healing roots.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000076|I will make sure Ragnar knows of your good work.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000074|Thank you.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000073|I harvested the healing roots.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000072|Those are the only ones with healing properties.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000071|If you can make sure you pick the mature roots.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000070|Good, good. I would be very grateful. We all would.|Grateful/relieved
INFO_IKENI7_00000069|I will harvest the healing roots.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000068|Any pair of hands willing to assist will be welcome.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000066|I need every Cultivator, including you to step up and help.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000065|Yes, to harvest them and bring them back here.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000064|You need someone to harvest the healing roots?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000062|And, in the meantime, we have a different problem.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000061|I'm sure you can get round a farmer, right?|2
INFO_IKENI7_00000060|And, if Born asks about this little redistribution, well...|1 – From after the player has got the roots
INFO_IKENI7_00000059|And, I can see you're smart.|6
INFO_IKENI7_00000058|Smart knows how to keep everyone happy. Smart knows how to keep the laws in perspective and turn a healthy profit.|5
INFO_IKENI7_00000057|No, no, stupid would only cause me trouble. Who wants stupid? Smart is what I need.|4
INFO_IKENI7_00000056|Do you take me for stupid?|3
INFO_IKENI7_00000055|Catch? What catch? You'll earn a handsome amount of Elexit, where's the catch in that?|2
INFO_IKENI7_00000054|What's the catch?|1 Option 4.1
INFO_IKENI7_00000053|I'm just saying you look like someone with potential. And there's nothing worse than wasted potential...|2
INFO_IKENI7_00000052|All right, all right.|1
INFO_IKENI7_00000051|Get to the point.|1 Option 1.3
INFO_IKENI7_00000050|Here's a reward for your honesty. I will make sure these get to where they should be.|Loudly, acting this out
INFO_IKENI7_00000049|Well, honest traveler, thank you for bringing these forbidden items to my attention.|Loudly, acting this out. Over acting his part.
INFO_IKENI7_00000048|I have the healing roots.|1 If he has the roots in his inventory
INFO_IKENI7_00000047|And if I just give the roots to Born?|4
INFO_IKENI7_00000046|Exactly what goods are you looking for?|1 Option 4.2
INFO_IKENI7_00000045|You could, you could. But, then Born's not going to be as financially grateful as me. Meaning he'll pay less. If I have to spell it out.|5
INFO_IKENI7_00000044|Born the Cultivator knows where they grow. And, if you could persuade him to let you harvest them then maybe I could persuade someone to give you Elexit for them.|3
INFO_IKENI7_00000043|Me? I don't want anything! But...I might know a few people in need of mature healing roots.|2 Answer to 'You want me to trade illegal goods?'
INFO_IKENI7_00000042|Yes?|2
INFO_IKENI7_00000041|About these rarities...|1 Option 3.1
INFO_IKENI7_00000040|I just do as any honest, loyal, law-abiding, practical Berserker should do.|Modest, stress on practical
INFO_IKENI7_00000039|And all for the right price.|7
INFO_IKENI7_00000038|No fuss, no overstretching our legal authorities. It's much better for everyone.|Reasonable
INFO_IKENI7_00000037|When someone discovers rare items that are legally questionable, I solve this problem without the need to take up the time of our busy official authorities.|Reasonable
INFO_IKENI7_00000036|I help people with problems.|Reasonable
INFO_IKENI7_00000033|You're looking for rare items?|1 Option3.1
INFO_IKENI7_00000032|I only have a limited selection, we are in Goliet and the Laws make a lot of items illegal.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000031|I have to gamble?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000030|You could say that, but once you offer the right price the odds are you'll always be a winner.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000029|Trade?! No, no! That would be illegal! No, no, I don't trade, I run a sort of lottery. One where you pay me for a chance to win the item of your choice.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000028|What items do you trade?|
INFO_IKENI7_00000026|I want to make a trade.|
INFO_IKENI7_00000025|Cautious, I like that.|2 Replying to No
INFO_IKENI7_00000024|Or, spend your Elexit living your dreams. Your choice.|5
INFO_IKENI7_00000022|You can spend your life dreaming of Elexit...|4 Sales pitch
INFO_IKENI7_00000021|Rare is where the Elexit is.|3
INFO_IKENI7_00000020|Rare items?|2
INFO_IKENI7_00000019|So, if you were to get your hands on rare, legally questionable items, I could, being a loyal Berserker, take that trouble off your hands.|1 All options lead to this line. Stress on rare
INFO_IKENI7_00000018|No, no, I want to solve problems. There's no profit in trouble.|2 Replying to I'm listening.
INFO_IKENI7_00000017|Illegal here is legal there, law's just a matter of geography, isn't it?|2 Answer to 'You want me to trade illegal goods?'
INFO_IKENI7_00000016|Sounds like you'd get me into trouble.|1 Option 2.3 Answer to 'Sounds like you'd get me into trouble.'
INFO_IKENI7_00000015|You want to trade illegal goods?|1 Option 2.2
INFO_IKENI7_00000014|And, if you did, then I, as an honest Berserker, could help put such mistakes right in a way that earns us both Elexit.|7
INFO_IKENI7_00000013|Then there's a newcomer like you. Well, any newcomer has the potential to make honest mistakes when it comes to legalities.|6
INFO_IKENI7_00000012|...'cept maybe being impaled up the unmentionables with a hot, rusty poker.|3
INFO_IKENI7_00000011|I'll bet, you look like the listening kind.|2 Replying to I'm listening.
INFO_IKENI7_00000009|It means you're discreet and discreet is just what I need.|3
INFO_IKENI7_00000007|Sounds like a scam.|1 Option 1.2
INFO_IKENI7_00000006|I'm listening.|1 Option 1.1
INFO_IKENI7_00000005|Of the financial kind. The kind where I've got money I'm just looking to give away and you have empty pockets to fill.|5
INFO_IKENI7_00000004|What problems?|4
INFO_IKENI7_00000003|Problem? Me? I never have problems, only solutions and I reckon we can solve problems for each other.|3
INFO_IKENI7_00000002|You have a problem with new faces?|2 Reply – Neutral
INFO_IKENI7_00000001|Well, there's a face I haven't seen before. Newcomer aren't you?|Considering the player
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000221|I'll see you around.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000220|All right then. In that case you might know more than me about what's going on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000219|I know, I've already spoken with Albert.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000218|Here. Take what you need from my chest.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000217|I don't like the idea of leaving so many goods behind, but well it's better if you have them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000216|We will see each other again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000215|I am sure we will see each other again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000214|Here's my key..|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000213|You helped us a lot.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000212|Take what you will from what is left.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000211|Here, please take my chest key.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000210|It hurts a little to leave...I honestly thought that I would spend the rest of my life here. But, then life is never a constant.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000209|The supplies you brought us from Goliet will help us greatly. Thank you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000208|Good work on the supply mission.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000207|I knew it was a good decision to let you in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000206|Congratulations on taking this step.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000205|So, you have successfully completed your first task for the Claws.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000204|Keep it up and you might earn the right to learn the rest of our secrets.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000203|I've heard that you've completed your first task for us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000202|Aah. Here you are. The man of the hour.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000201|Good luck. We will see each other again. I am sure of it.|

INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000197|I have already taken everything I need for the journey.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000196|First of which, here. Take this key.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000195|I still have a few things to finalize before I go.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000194|But, enough of that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000193|May your business go well. I am sure we will see each other again.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000192|If you say so.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000191|I can take care of myself|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000190|Very well, as long as you think you can make it on your own.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000189|And, as for the Elex and the weapons you acquired, well, the purposed of them should be obvious.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000188|The recording gave us the leverage we needed to persuade him to help us.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000187|Well, the guy in that recording is now going to guide us through the mountains.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000186|Why did you need the recording from the Fort?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000185|If we have the capability to build mechs, then we will always be in a position to make a few shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000184|For our protection. And we also need something to trade.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000183|For the same reason we wanted the Clerics' research.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000182|Why do you need the fighting Colossus blueprints?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000181|Yes, as provisions for the long journey.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000180|They helped us find a way over the mountains safely so we can relocate our activities there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000179|So, that's why you needed the supplies from Goliet?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000178|All the jobs you did for us had a specific purpose.|

INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000176|No thanks, I still have something to take care of here.|

INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000172|You happened!|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000171|We are all leaving.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000170|Did something happen?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000169|You are leaving?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000168|I wouldn't have wanted to leave without saying goodbye.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000167|Excellent.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000166|Well, it doesn't matter, the important thing is that you are here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000165|The one that I left for you in the drop box?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000164|Which message?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000163|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000162|Ah! It's good you're here. I assume you got my message?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000161|Hmm... There is a note in here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000160|So, I acquired Mad Bob's key...let's see what's next.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000159|That's the Elex secured.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000158|Recordings secured.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000157|Perhaps they have more back in their hideout.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000156|Looks like I've completed all my assignments.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000155|Research documents, assignments complete.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000154|Colossus blueprints, done.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000153|Let's see if the Claws have any more jobs for me at their hideout.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000152|That's one down..|Considering
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000150|I've nothing to put in.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000146|No problem. What would you like to build?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000145|I would like to donate shards to the camp.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000144|So? What'll it be?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000143|That is a shame, but maybe you will reconsider.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000142|Let me know what you think would be helpful, I will take care of it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000141|We are hoping to make the place look better and to get the equipment we need, you know workbenches and things like that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000140|And if you like, you can even donate to a specific cause.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000139|You can be sure that everything you give will go to helping people.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000138|That is great, I'm glad to hear that, you'll have our gratitude.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000136|No, I'm not giving you anything.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000135|Yeah, I'll make a donation.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000134|Why should I donate something to you?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000133|Are you here to make a donation? Every shard you can give will go into building up our little community here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000132|Hi, I'm Annie.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000131|The Clerics owe you their thanks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000130|I will reward you accordingly for this service.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000129|You took care of our problem with the Elex trading, even though you knew that we can't accept you into our ranks.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000128|Join us and you can participate in our knowledge, faith and our technology.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000127|The knowledge to make the world into what it once was and much more.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000126|Where the Outlaws profit and the Berserkers roll in the dirt, we have knowledge.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000125|Because, we are the last bastion against the Albs. Our strength, our faith and our technology are the only things that can stop them.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000124|Why would I want to become a Cleric?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000123|The energy the Albs use in magic is torn from the world. It damages them and it damages the world.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000122|Mana puts our bodies and minds in harmony with the magic we use. For us it is natural.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000121|You can see that in Goliet. We don't need Mana like the Albs have to have their Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000120|You can see that Goliet. We don't need Mana like the Albs have to have their Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000119|It is the power of Mana that is addictive, not the substance itself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000118|There are those who have lost themselves in the journey, but they are rare.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000117|Isn't Mana addictive like Elex?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000116|That sounds dangerous.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000115|Those who cast magic will tell you that while the Albs lose their emotions closing off their minds, Mana opens the mind, connects you and the world.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000114|That we have yet to understand. Though we do study it. Even now Thorald, the Pilgrim, has withdrawn from Elex to study its mysteries in the hope we can grow stronger.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000113|How does Mana help you cast magic?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000112|Even so, I recommend avoiding it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000111|But, don't worry, it's a positive experience that will leave you happy about life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000110|If someone causes trouble, then they are either thrown out, see a Suggestor for reorientation, or both.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000109|Our Suggestors are the reason things remain peaceful in the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000108|What's a Suggestor?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000107|You'll find him in the castle. He likes to stay close to the generators.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000106|There are many who seek promotion and you must show you are worthy of that honor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000105|You will have to prove that you are as skilled a fighter as they are.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000103|Alois is the Judicator in charge of the city.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000102|Who is Alois?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000101|Just go straight down the path into the inner city, you should find him there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000099|Where can I find Erich?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000098|Before all this happened here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000097|If you want do better then you have to work your way up. That was my plan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000096|Sure, you get access to armor and a few nice stims, but that's it. Then you get none stop hassle.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000095|Yeah. The lowest of the low in the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000094|You are a Runner?|Still stressed
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000093|The same applies for our Legates and Paladins. Each new rank brings new advantages, obligations and privileges such as equipment.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000092|Acolytes can learn the art of suggestion, train and learn the fundamentals of our way of life.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000091|People who are new to our ranks are welcomed as an Acolyte.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000090|Tell me how promotion works within the Hort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000089|We're short of personnel, so he would welcome a new Acolyte. |
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000088|You should start by talking to Judicator Reinhold up in the Citadel. You'll find him more approachable than Ulbricht.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000087|You'll have to prove yourself to the Judicators.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000086|How can I be promoted to Legate?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000085|Sure, the other Legates are out there using their skills and suggestion to take the fight forward, but we're here giving the Hort the Mechs that keep us safe.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000084|I'm a Legate responsible for procuring materials, producing new Mechs and repairing our Mech squadrons, among other duties.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000083|Mechanic?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000082|So, you're some sort of mechanic?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000081|If you truly wish to succeed you will need to focus on achievement at every level, without that you will never advance.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000080|And it is only Legates who have the right to be promoted to become a Paladin.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000079|Acolytes may become Legates, if they have enough training and they earn the honor.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000078|That is the true beginning to your journey.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000077|If Judicator Reinhold accepts that you have the right abilities then you will be permitted the honor of becoming an Acolyte.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000076|Well...first you have to go to Judicator Reinhold and prove you are worthy of joining the Clerics.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000075|Yes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000074|Hahaha... Wait... You are being serious?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000073|How can I become a Paladin?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000071|We're also researchers, searching for new uses for Elex.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000070|But, we Paladins, aren't just warriors for Calaan with special abilities.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000069|Correct. Only a Paladin is allowed to wear armor like mine.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000068|You said you are a Paladin?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000067|You've made your point.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000066|Okay, okay. I got it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000065|No.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000064|Although, if you'd like to make a voluntary donation?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000063|I have to ask for shards, but okay I understand, you don't want to pay.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000062|I'm just doing my job.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000061|Okay, okay, back off there. |
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000060|Ask me for shards again and I'll bury you right here, right now.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000059|I think I'll take a look in your pockets myself.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000058|Well, my friend... I'm not sure I believe you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000057|I don't have enough to pay you.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000056|There's others in there who aren't as understanding as me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000055|But, watch yourself in there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000054|You keep your shards.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000053|I don't want to spill any blood here...|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000052|Woah, okay, calm down there.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000051|You want to find out?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000050|Because, you're the bad end to a shit day and I'm looking for someone to take it out on.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000049|Because, I once throttled a troll with my bare hands.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000048|Really? And why is that?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000047|You've chosen the wrong person to pick a fight with.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000045|And, if you hurt the Fort you'll hurt me.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000044|People who don't pay hurt the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000043|Well, as I'm the one in charge of who comes in and I'm saying there's a fee. There's a fee.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000042|There's no entrance fee, this is a con. I'm not paying.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000040|You could have been sent by Calaan himself. Orders are orders. Clerics, recruits, traders with permits. Understand?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000039|I came from the Berserkers and would like to...|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000038|I don't care what news you have. I have my orders.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000037|There is currently a four month waiting period, so unless you find a merchant who is wanting to give up theirs, then you can't.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000036|But, if you want to look, try Rainer, he is recruiting men throughout Abessa.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000035|Perhaps, you've not met one because they don't consider you worthy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000034|Find a suggestor who considers you worthy. There are Suggestors recruiting across all the lands of Magalan.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000033|No. I am not authorized to recruit new Acolytes.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000032|Can you recruit me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000031|I have important news, let me through.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000030|Where can I get a trading permit?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000029|I want to become a Cleric.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000028|We're just lucky it didn't kill us all.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000027|The Mech could have decided the ground was its owner and so tried to kill me for standing on it.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000026|Can you imagine that? Some idiot just went in there and chose a random owner.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000025|The problem was the owner routine wasn't calling the parent array correctly.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000024|I'm just glad there wasn't more damage.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000023|I was able to find the malfunction thanks to your help.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000022|How are the Mech repairs coming along?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000021|He takes care of his own interests and does what people tell him. I only wish they were all like that.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000020|Blake is the only overseer who doesn't make trouble here.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000019|Say, are you even listening to me?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000018|What about Blake?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000017|I mean that bloody guy.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000016|The guy who survived the Duke's jackals and who fled the Fort streaming with blood?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000015|Baxter, Bloody Baxter? The guy who ruled the Fort here before the Duke took over?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000014|The Bloody? Who are you talking about?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000013|Not the best Overseer we have, let's put it that way. Total self-righteous asshole, to put it another. But who am I to question the Duke?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000012|Blake is one of the District Overseer here, he's in the upper section of the Fort.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000011|Who is Blake?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000009|Right, I will take care of his funeral as soon as I can.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000008|Below Ragnar's stronghold.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000007|Where is his body?|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000006|Thank you for letting me know.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000005|I knew nothing good would happen to that old soak, but...dead? He was a good friend.|Sad
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000004|Yes... I got that... Shit...|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000003|He's dead.|
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000002|He is... I mean... what?|Shocked
INFO_WEIDMANNFX8_00000001|Your buddy Alvar is dead.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000728|Calaan will save me...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000727|Not yet... I... I can't...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000726|But father? No? no...no...no...no...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000725|Not today...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000724|No, no, please...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000723|A sin...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000722|Calaan will save me...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000721|I won't...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000720|Not me...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000719|I think I'm making more of a difference doing what I'm doing. Askor, though, was a driven man, becoming a Paladin was all he wanted. |Considering
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000718|Yes. But, trust me, I'm happier with my job collecting waifs and strays than becoming a Paladin and going out to the front lines.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000717|You recently became a Warrior didn't you? You and Askor are both eligible to be Paladins?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000716|You don't know what you're talking about.|Crumbling
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000715|Then tell me.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000714|Tell me, or you'll have to tell Ragnar.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000713|Then you find out Barin goes to where the Seedling was found and suddenly think he is a prime suspect.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000712|You were a rival to Askor. You carry a sword.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000711|You think? I just observe things. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000710|You seem well-informed.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000709|And, if the experiments failed, they threw the creatures into their Converter and sucked the Elex right back out of them.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000708|The Albs have chosen to accelerate that process, driving this mutation and enhancing the creatures further. Even adding some sort of control mechanisms.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000707|They obviously did not get far in Edan.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000706|From here they could set the Converter to process metals, plants, soil, people...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000705|I will find you when I have anything more to say. I think we can help each other Jax. But, first I have something I must do.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000704|I think we can help each other Jax.|

INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000694|Magalan, our beautiful home. Born of Calaan and a gift to all. But, not all is beauty out there. Amongst the wonders lies danger, So, remember, don't just carry a weapon, train how to use.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000693|This is me, Herbert, broadcasting from Orbit to bring a warning to all Free People out there. Stay safe in the wilderness.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000692|Greetings from the fiery heart of Magalan.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000691|But, open your mind and you will learn of his ways. You will understand what he offers us.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000690|So, if you hear a voice from Orbit then it is surely mine. And I am but the mouthpiece of Calaan and his mighty wisdom.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000689|There are a lot of lost souls out there we can reach.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000688|You see, the work I do here is educational. From here I am able to warn everyone of the dangers of Elex.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000687|We can tell people about the dangers of the wilderness and the benefits of Calaan's wisdom.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000686|From here we can broadcast to all of Abessa.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000685|My own communications station.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000684|What is this place?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000683|It is my purpose to spread the word of Calaan and to explain his meaning to all.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000682|That doesn't mean he isn't interested in you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000681|There is following and there is understanding. Keep your mind open to his words.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000680|Those who are yet to find Calaan often misinterpret his will for 'chance'.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000679|I already follow Calaan.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000678|I'm not interested in Calaan.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000677|I came by here by chance.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000675|You will find the city of Calaan located deep inside Ignadon between the cliffs north of the Crater.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000674|Return to the dam and follow the road to the east.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000673|Well, if you are seeking the Hort then you are on the correct path. |

INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000668|Such as?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000667|Come to the family of Calaan, come to Ignadon and rejoice in disciplined service from morning until night.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000666|Laws and exile are what await you in Edan, lawlessness, debauchery and a lonely death are the mark of Tavar. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000665|Knowledge and technology are gifts that offer us salvation. We can build our future with our own hands.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000664|The Berserkers talk of nature, but their magic relies on Elex. And we know that Elex twists the body and tears the soul.|

INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000662|Great, happy dining.|

INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000658|No thanks, I'd think rather be eaten by a troll.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000657|Which is how all of this brackish water was able to contaminate the entire level.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000656|Ah, this is how I escaped some of those mutants. I cut through one of the hoses to block the way.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000655|This is the control wing of the Converter.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000654|But, if you ask me, it is just a matter of time until the Albs come back to suck the life out of all the people living in Edan. They want control of all the Elex on Magalan.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000653|The Berserkers didn't seem to enjoy having a Converter right on their front door. Probably because it was Berserkers being thrown into it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000652|It was obviously never put into full operation.|

INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000530|We're not likely to find a delicacy like this again. You should take advantage of this opportunity. Trust me, you'll like it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000529|Are you sure? You don't know what you're missing.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000528|I hope you enjoy it, but don't expect me to eat it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000527|Yes?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000526|About your meal.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000525|Alive or dead, you don't eat me, get it?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000524|I'm not going to help you if I have to worry about being turned into a meal.|

INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000514|But, one thing before I do.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000505|Then I will bring you the cyclops's heart.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000504|It is rumored to have its own following of mutants that hunt out Elex for it. The heart of that creature, it would make for a meal beyond imagining.|

INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000498|Come and find me tomorrow.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000496|Well, if you must, I'm sure you will prove a good meal once I've killed you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000495|Take it? We eat it. We will dine together and share our meal with a few friends.|Amused at his own joke, friends = the Alb brains he's cooked
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000494|How do you take it?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000493|Ah, good. I have just finished my preparations. The Elex is ready.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000492|Tell me where it is and I will help you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000490|There's only one animal I can think of, but I don't know how I could find it.|Dismissive
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000489|What animal?|Dismissive
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000488|If you really are only eating for nutrition and Elex, then what if I could show you an animal with concentrated Elex in it?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000487|But, if they're dead they can make me stronger. They can make us stronger.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000486|I don't kill Albs to eat them. I'm not crazy.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000485|If you kill an animal would you leave it to rot rather than eat it?|Cool logic
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000484|Kill me? It's you who's going to die.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000483|What are you, a vegetarian?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000482|I'd been to all those places myself.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000481|Of course not. You can't read dead minds.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000480|And you got this by eating their brains?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000479|You got your information didn't you?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000478|I told you our plans were aligned.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000477|All I did was remove the need for a Converter. So, where is the issue with that? They call themselves Albs, yet they act with blind emotion.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000476|So what if I ate the bodies of fallen soldiers? So what if it was more than once?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000475|Shortsighted stupidity.|Annoyed
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000474|That's the real reason you were thrown out of Xacor isn't it?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000473|Nutrition, Elex. they kept me alive, they kept me an Alb.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000472|Those bodies would have been cast into the Converter to recover the Elex from them, so why not eat them there and then?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000471|I was starving. The Elex was leaching from my body, just as it has from yours. I was given a chance to survive and that moment changed my life.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000470|My unit became stranded in the mountains, surrounded by Clerics, my comrades fell one by one.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000469|Many soldiers have turned to eating the flesh of the fallen if they are cut off in battle.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000468|Can you honestly say you aren't?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000467|But, I only eat what I kill. Are you going to make me kill you?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000466|Commander Jax, favored servant of the Hybrid, you must have a lot of Elex in that brain of yours...|Considering
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000465|That depends, are you going to try and eat me?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000464|If you want to turn down good food that's up to you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000463|You seriously want me to eat that?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000462|So, you lied to me?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000461|So, that's why you wanted me to bring you those heads.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000460|You're a cannibal?!|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000458|Or, are you judging me like they did in Xacor? Are you going to try and force me from this camp?|Turning cold
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000456|Here I prepared this soup from the heads you brought me. Their brains may have been pitiful in life, but they concentrated the Elex they were given. Now, that Elex becomes ours.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000455|The Elex, concentrated by their minds will help us feel what it is to be a true Alb, it feeds our strength.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000454|Most people don't understand this at first. But, this really does have not just flavor, but strength.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000453|You want to eat that?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000450|I am very glad that you want to be here for this celebration of Alb strength.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000449|As you can see, the others, our special guests, are already there.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000448|The meal?|Grim, beginning to realise the meal is made from the Alb heads he brought back to Arx
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000447|Here, the meal is ready.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000446|Not now.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000445|Oh, these friends are the closest you can imagine.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000444|Whatever it does, the taste is sensational. And preparing it is an art. I will complete my preparations and you can share it. Maybe, it will open your mind.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000443|The Albs stopped being Albs when they handed control to him.|Disappointed
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000442|Twisted? Reliant on others? No.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000441|Maybe I could too.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000440|Who knows? The Hybrid says he can see the future.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000439|Open your mind to what?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000438|You want to be like the Hybrid?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000437|It opened the Hybrid's mind, why not mine?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000436|Yes. But, a concentrated, focused form of Elex.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000435|You mean you ate Elex?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000434|In the evening I mostly experimented with new preparation methods for ingesting purified Elex. They made me feel...stronger.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000433|I served my time on patrol, I served the Hybrid.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000432|I told you, we can work together. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000431|You doubted my ability to get anything at all. Admit it, you are impressed.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000430|Well, perhaps I can make use of it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000429|It seems you can do what you said.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000428|What did you want? The Hybrid's birthday and inside leg measurement? That information is highly classified.|Annoyed
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000427|Is that all the information you have?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000426|Right. That sounds like it could be useful information.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000424|Give me some time. I will see what information I can find for you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000423|Well, my mind is free now.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000422|Your mind was just as closed to my intellect as the other Albs were. You were a soldier, a good one, but you had fallen under the Hybrid's complete control.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000421|The Albs have grown weak under the Hybrid's leadership. They reject anything they don't understand even if it could bring them strength.|Sneering
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000420|Jax, when you were in Xacor, you were focused on killing the Hybrid's enemies.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000418|Why didn't I hear anything about your research when I was in Xacor?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000417|Why did Xacor reject your work?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000416|No, They didn't understand the value of my work.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000415|Is there anyone else in Xacor who can read dead mines like this?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000413|You're unlikely to understand. Concentrate on your skills and leave me to mine.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000412|Let's see what secrets his meagre cranium can reveal.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000411|Wait here and I will read the mind and bring you the information you need.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000410|Are you still under the Hybrid's control, or can you think freely now?|Sneering
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000407|And, as an added bonus they will help us get into the minds of our enemies.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000406|Good.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000405|Then follow me.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000404|All right, let's eat.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000403|You have friends?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000400|Now? Now, I think I'm going to go and eat.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000399|So, what will you do with it now?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000398|Well, I can sleep freer, they are unlikely to spare more men to come after me for some time.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000397|Idiots. Well, at least they have given me chance to prove my work. I told you they were imbeciles.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000396|How did you extract this information from a dead brain?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000395|Tiraz had been to the Converter in Ignadon, there is a secure storage there that requires the access code 4486.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000394|The fact you killed him so easily shows why he needed to die. He was an embarrassment of an Alb. The Hybrid's demands have only made us weaker.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000393|I would never have believed you would turn out to be a pessimist. Believe it, believe in my skill. It's good information..|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000392|And, are you sure that code is still current?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000389|It seems Pollux had orders to kill me, he failed. I, however, succeeded and I can tell you that the Converter in northern Abessa can be accessed with the code 3210.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000388|A shame we don't have a more intelligent example, but I will make of it what I can.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000387|I learned the code to open the eastern Converter in Xacor. It is 0666. That should be useful to you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000386|And, so we remove another useless Alb from the Hybrid's ranks.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000385|Only Calaan knows the way to salvation and in the Hort, his stronghold in Ignadon, he promises you food, training, protection and a future.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000384|But, all that Tavar has to offer is chem addiction, exploitation and a lonely death. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000383|Desperate times lead to desperate actions, but don't be fooled by the lies of Tavar. They talk of freedom, of profit. Of fun, sex, good times and beer.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000382|If Elex does this to animals you can imagine what it will do to you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000381|Elex has seeped into the bones of our world and the bones of our creatures, twisting them into new unnatural forms.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000380|We all must choose sides in the battles to come, make sure you choose the side that counts. Join the Clerics today.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000379|The threat from the north, the curse of the Albs must be eliminated.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000378|To all those who are listening, follow my example and join with the forces of Ignadon. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000377|Calaan offers salvation and protection for all those who give themselves to him.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000376|As the god Calaan has protected us from the downfall until this day, so he will always stand with us during difficult times.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000375|Stay pure of chems, pledge yourself to Calaan and a new life awaits you in the service of Magalan. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000374|You should know there is a place of refuge waiting for all in the Hort in Ignadon.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000373|People of Magalan, this is Herbert, broadcasting spiritual advice and handy tips to all the Free People.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000372|Come to the Hort. Come to Ignadon and discover the truth.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000371|Leave the chems behind and discover the high that faith can bring. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000370|Adrenalin, drink and chems. They can give us all a kick, a lift, a high. But, they also cloud your mind, distort your spirit and poison your body.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000369|Why are you hiding here?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000368|Why do you need Elex?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000367|Provided you help me achieve my plan.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000366|And, I just need their heads. You can leave the rest of them to rot.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000365|All three of your pursuers are dead.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000364|Never mind. We'll talk later.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000363|Here is the head of Tiraz.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000362|Here is Pollux's head.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000361|I have Bartox's head.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000360|Something tells me I will need this.|To himself when taking the head off the head of one of the Albs he needs to kill for Arx
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000359|You shouldn't have fought me.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000358|You won't need this anymore.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000357|Tell me more about your time in Xacor.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000356|About the Albs who are pursuing you...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000354|I'll send their locations to your adjutor.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000353|The third is Tiraz, I last saw him on the border to Ignadon. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000352|The second is Pollux, he trailed me through western Abessa, but I managed to throw him off.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000351|The first is Bartox. He is searching the southern reaches of Xacor. Which only goes to prove he is an idiot.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000350|They have sent three commanders to find me. I'd be flattered if they weren't all imbeciles.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000349|Come to me when you are ready to take action.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000348|The Albs of Xacor won't think, they will act. And that will lead to our deaths.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000347|I will think about it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000346|Tell me about the Albs that are hunting you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000345|I know the area. I will find it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000344|Very well, I will find it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000343|Yes, a camp in the mountain area between Edan and Abessa called Origin. I've made it my base and they need help defending it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000342|I have a camp in some ruins west of Goliet.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000341|You should tell me where to meet if we become separated.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000340|And we will know their plans.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000339|Good, then soon I can fill myself with their minds.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000338|You fight for my cause and I will bring you the heads of your pursuers.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000337|The two of us are in the same position. We should work together.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000336|You sound like the Albs in Xacor.|Sneering
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000335|There's no way this can work.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000334|Find my pursuers and bring me their minds.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000333|If you bring me their heads, yes.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000332|You really think you can read their minds?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000331|Help me and I will share my knowledge with you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000330|You can't scare Albs. No, if I get their heads, I can read their minds to learn how they plan to capture me and I'm sure I can get you some useful tactical information when I do.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000329|I will know how they are planning to capture me. And what their plans are for you.|Lying to hide his true purpose
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000328|Killing one set of Albs isn't enough. I need to know what they're thinking. If I get their heads, I can read their minds and learn their plans.|Lying to hide his true purpose
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000327|Cut their heads off? That should scare others off from pursuing you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000326|You want their heads? Are you crazy?|Doubtful
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000325|And, I want their heads.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000324|I want them dead.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000323|Once I have them then I can think of the future.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000322|The only thing that matters right now is taking the heads of the Albs who are hunting me.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000321|So, what is your plan now?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000320|Look, you're an exile, I'm an exile. Here we stand the two of us, both superior to the Albs that serve the Hybrid. You and I, we should be the ones to decide our fate and theirs.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000319|Yes.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000318|It sounds like you were a loyal soldier|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000317|They wouldn't exile you for research. Are you serious?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000316|But, my efforts weren't appreciated. They rejected me, they drove me from Xacor. Now, I must live in exile.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000315|Yes, but I did my own research into shared minds. I experienced what it is to be an Alb - a true Alb.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000314|The collective mind is part of the Hybrid's strength.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000313|I believe there are ways to make Albs stronger. That there are ways we can...share minds to strengthen them.|Dodging the truth (he eats Alb brains for strength), implying research instead
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000312|So, now it's your turn.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000311|There, that is my story.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000310|Then your executioner also failed. They will have to execute him when they discover that.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000309|But, I failed a mission for the Hybrid. And there were Albs there ready to stage an execution.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000308|Speak and I will consider it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000307|So, tell me why you left Xacor.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000306|Then keep your secrets.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000305|I was fortunate, I fell from a cliff and they presumed I was dead. I have been trying to recover my strength and get answers since then.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000304|I still don't know the full story. Not all of it|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000303|I failed an important mission for the Hybrid. So, they attempted to execute me as the Directive commands.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000302|Very well, I will tell you my story, then you tell me yours.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000300|You answer mine.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000299|Answer my questions.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000298|So, why aren't you still a loyal commander of Xacor?|Answering a question with a question
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000297|So, why aren't you still a loyal soldier of Xacor?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000296|While I have had to leave Xacor, I believe in the Hybrid. It is through his insight that we will survive. His powers will bring order to Xacor.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000295|Weak, stupid, emotional.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000294|They've abandoned the Hybrid because of primitive fear and with no idea what they will do instead.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000293|Overcome by emotion.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000292|Psh, those idiots don't even know what they want. They are weak.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000291|Are you with the Separatists?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000290|I have been cut loose from Xacor. I can't go back. I have to find a new way to fulfill my destiny.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000289|It seems like we have shared similar fates.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000288|Why aren't you with your unit?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000287|We were told you had been executed, but recently, I heard rumors of someone who sounded like you. I began to suspect you were still alive.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000286|Not personally, but every Alb knows of your achievements. Everyone heard of your crash.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000285|Have we met before?|Wary
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000284|You've stopped taking Elex. You look...different.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000283|I was wondering if I would see you again.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000282|Commander Jax...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000281|If he goes without it for any time then he's in pain. Without it, I know he'll die.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000280|I don't know how he survived, but whatever that machine did to him, it's left him needing Elex.|His brother will die without Elex
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000279|They were going to throw him in. He escaped somehow, but the Converter had changed him.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000278|The Albs captured him and took him to that Converter.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000277|Persuade me.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000276|Why would you do that?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000275|Who says I took it?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000274|Use your chance to get out of this, or leave it. Your choice.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000272|I've been fine so far, but... You look better equipped than me. Could you take care of those mutants? Then supplies wouldn't be a problem for either of us.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000271|What happens if you run out of supplies up here?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000270|I could be useful to you when it comes to technical questions. In return, you can help me avoid situations like this in the future. What do you think? Can we team up?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000269|I should be able to continue on my way in another week, or so.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000268|Only a week, or so. But, if their numbers keep diminishing at the rate they are...|Considering
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000267|How long have you been here?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000266|I'm very patient.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000265|You're just going to wait up here?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000264|There's no such thing as luck.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000263|I'll wait a little longer for them to lose interest.|Relaxed.
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000262|But, there are still enough to kill me, so...|Relaxed.
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000261|Maybe, there aren't as many now.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000260|There was a whole horde of them when I arrived.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000259|The mutants down there were too much for you?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000257|Then they'll leave and I can continue my journey.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000256|At some point those mutants down there will find an easier meal.|Calm
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000253|And, I am sure that he will find his purpose somewhere.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000252|I will remember that.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000251|Interesting. I am to find a purpose.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000250|Born, collect experience, tested to destruction?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000249|Is that not the definition of human life?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000248|You do that.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000247|But, don't worry, he won't go wrong. He's perfect. I made him, how could he not be?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000246|Well, I haven't installed a self-destruct if that's what you mean.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000245|He will only act in self-defense, or the defense of a human companion, or if he comes up with a reason to do it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000244|He can't get angry, he doesn't hold grudges.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000243|No, no, I developed him like this so that he couldn't be dangerous. He's a prototype, not a finished soldier.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000242|And, if that goes wrong?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000241|You set a weapon loose out there? What if he becomes dangerous?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000240|He should continue to do that.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000239|To go out, discover and return.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000238|That was his task.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000237|You are his creator. He returned to you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000236|Free? Oh, he doesn't understand the concept of free, just the stated definition of the word.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000235|Still, as long as he learns and I can collect his experiences.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000234|But, we'll have to build the right machines for mass production.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000233|Well, I hope so. Because, right now I don't have the parts to build more of them. I mean the plan is to build more.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000231|A robot should come in useful.|Plus one cold. Logical
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000230|Tested to destruction?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000229|The aim was to test him to destruction. The finished production model comes next, I'll refine that based on what Falk learns.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000226|His settings can. His experiences can. Then one soldier will teach the others. See? It's much better to lose circuits than flesh and blood.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000225|He can transfer to a new body?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000224|It's fully adaptable though, I can upgrade any element of his training and anything he learns can be uploaded and sent out a new body.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000223|That's my design in action. I used synaptic mapping to build his basic reactions and personality, it's all uploaded.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000222|Falk is more than a robot, he's a person.|Minus one cold.
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000221|We can secure Magalan for the future, without the loss of lives.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000220|And we can have war without casualties.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000219|I mean we have weapons, fighting machines, bots, but we still need a human presence. Replace those humans with a machine... A machine that thinks like you and me?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000218|In war we need an army that doubles our fighting strength, but without the human cost.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000217|Isn't it obvious?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000216|Is he free now?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000215|Why did you build him?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000214|I hope so.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000213|I hope I will function well. I cannot see how this revelation should impair me. On the contrary, I think being more informed should improve my capabilities.|feeling positive
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000212|Of course, you are going to be uneasy. But, I can assure you, that any deception was not intentional on my part. I didn't know who, what I was. Am.|Correcting himself, this is a new thing to get used to
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000211|I understand. You were operating on a false assumption.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000210|A real Cleric would be more use to me than a machine.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000209|I am pleased that I now do understand what I am.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000208|I will admit that it was highly unsatisfactory not to have understood my true nature.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000207|He is a genius. If a little, peculiar in personality.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000206|What do you think about your creator?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000205|Albs suppress their emotions. I wish to explore mine. They are losing theirs, I am developing mine.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000204|That isn't accurate, no.|Considering this
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000203|You sound like an Alb.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000202|But, I had observed that many people suffer from such issues. Though, I do wonder if my reaction to this revelation is lacking in emotion. Are feelings something I must learn?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000201|Emotions, for instance, I don't experience them as others do.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000200|No. I was aware of discrepancies in my behavior.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000199|You didn't know that you are a machine?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000198|I feel... strong.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000197|My systems appear to be functioning correctly.|Exploring the sensations. A little shocked by the realisation of who/what he is - an android.
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000196|How are you feeling?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000195|At least, so I've been told. I don't actually know what these components are supposed to do. But, the Cleric who told me to come here insists it will change the world.|Jovial then confessing
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000194|I know that area. I'm sure I can locate that camp. And I'd be happy to help with its defense.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000193|I have joined a camp in the mountains between Edan and Abessa. They call it Origin. I've settled there and they want help defending the place.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000192|Understood. Meet at the abandoned camp. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000191|There's an abandoned camp in the ruins to the west of Goliet. We can meet there.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000190|Where should we meet if we become separated?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000189|I'm not planning on falling. And, I can't see you doing much fighting.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000188|Together we fight, together we fall.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000187|Yes, I can do that. You will not regret this decision.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000186|Yes, you can come with me. If you think you can follow my orders.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000185|Alright.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000184|About Falk...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000183|You are beginning a new stage of evolution now. Go with your new friend. Learn about yourself. Your new routines should help you access the data that tells you what you are. Take good care of him won't you?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000182|Is he all right?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000181|Initializing...|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000180|Falk?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000179|Wait here and I will finish up with my work.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000178|Of course that is part of his programming.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000177|Hah, a friend. He gets more human everyday. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000176|He has obviously chosen you as his companion.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000175|I am thankful to you for bringing him back.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000174|Much more than that.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000173|So...he's a robot?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000172|I will install these parts and make him better than before.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000171|What upgrades?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000170|Of course. He is my masterpiece. And with the components you've brought me, I will finish his upgrades.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000169|You created him?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000168|He is my greatest invention. The pride of creation.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000167|Isn't he a wonderful creature?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000166|What is wrong with him?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000165|I will hear Calaan's words. Words. Words. Words. Words.|Stuck in a loop
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000164|I was.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000163|I thought you were traveling by order of a Legate?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000162|I am ready to hear Calaan's words.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000161|It is time I told you something, something, something important.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000160|Yes, Falk, your work on this task is complete.|Taken aback
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000159|Have I completed my task?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000158|As I knew you would.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000157|If you say so.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000156|Yes?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000155|About these components you need...?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000153|Logic and curiosity are the paths to enlightenment.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000152|Thinking is easy. Finding reliable data is the difficult part.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000151|You think too much.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000150|Truth is hard to determine. Now I am a step closer to knowing it.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000149|Whatever you do next. I know whether you lied or told the truth to that question, it will help me guess what you will do next.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000148|Why are you asking me this?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000147|If we don't ask, we don't learn. I have data and now I need context.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000146|That's none of your business.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000145|Technology is not moral, or immoral. People are.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000144|Sounds like Calaan has it all planned out.|Unconvinced.
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000143|So, you will learn when you see him.|Recitation
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000142|So, my Legate says.|Recitation
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000141|Kal-ern's will is to help all through technology.|Recitation
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000140|You seem pretty certain about that.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000139|The technology that has been preserved, the technology that has been designed here, Magalan must thank the Clerics for all of it.|Litany
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000138|The Clerics are not to blame for the Albs.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000137|It is Kal-ern's will. Only the Clerics believe in science and study. Only the Clerics had the capability to fabricate these things.|Litany
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000136|We should thank the Clerics for the Albs?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000135|This is the work of the Clerics?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000134|We might not have the resources our ancestors did, but look what the Clerics have achieved since.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000133|An example of how Elex has revolutionized technology.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000132|We will...we will be victorious.|Trying to answer, but unable, goes to a stock reply.
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000131|But, our mechs and energy weapons are a match for theirs.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000130|That is a question for my Legate.|Deflecting
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000129|I was thinking the same thing.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000128|Are you all right? You're not making much sense.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000127|Sure of what?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000126|You don't sound so sure.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000125|How can you defeat the Albs?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000124|Well, if you're worried, maybe we can get you some help after this is finished.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000123|Building? Well, the components are for...They will...We will use them in the advance of technology to defeat the Albs.|Trying to answer, but unable, goes to a stock reply. He needs to sound unsure.
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000122|Is it military equipment you're building with this?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000121|That's one good thing about military equipment, it is built to be durable. Some of it has survived for centuries.|Positive
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000120|I'll have to run some tests, but if it looks undamaged we can be hopeful it will work.|Considering
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000119|I have the miniature Elex battery.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000118|I have the high-performance CPU.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000117|Now, these elements help drive our technology forward.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000116|Elex is a resource. It is only what we do with it that should be judged morally not the substance itself.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000115|What do you think of Elex?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000114|While it is interesting to consider what the world might have been, the true value of knowledge is in what it will help us become.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000113|I have studied history and old technology. There are no traces of either element in the records, or in the Old World machines we salvage. It was the Clerics who first began using Elex.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000112|I have no...feelings about it. I simply observe.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000111|How do you know Elex and gaurudium weren't here before the Comet?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000110|Are you pleased the Comet hit?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000109|Like Elex, gaurudium wasn't found here before the Comet struck. |
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000108|Gift?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000107|Now, that is a lie. For I haven't met anyone who has survived outside without doing that. It is morally wrong, but it is sometimes the only way to stay alive. So, what should I make of your lie?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000106|Then I have found my role.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000105|You're right, too many people don't think.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000104|Questions should come before decisions.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000103|And, that is morally wrong. I should be sad, or angry. I should not wish to talk to you. And, yet, I don't know why you killed that person. And I know most people out here have to kill to survive.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000102|Yes.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000101|But, then knowledge always depends on context to have meaning. For instance, let me ask you. Have you ever killed anyone?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000100|No.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000099|Yes. He teaches us about the importance of knowledge.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000098|Teachings?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000097|He is...he is, well we have little in the way of real data, but the teachings tell us much.|Stuck, doesn't really know about Calaan. He's been programmed with a cover story, but not given the information to back it up
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000096|Kal-ern is our god.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000095|Who is Calaan?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000094|We believe in Kal-ern, who we serve in the hope of knowledge and freedom.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000093|We are the technologically superior of all the cultural and sociological sub-groupings on Magalan apart from the Albs.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000092|An amazing element, isn't it? Another gift from the Comet.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000091|I have the gaurudium.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000090|If you say so.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000089|We adapt, we survive, we move forward.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000088|Mutants adapted to the new environment through Elex. We have done the same through technology.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000087|But, the Comet didn't just bring destruction, it also brought Elex. And, it is Elex that gave those who survived the leap forward in technology that the Clerics have driven.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000086|Oh, yes. It would have been very different from today. We lost millions of people in the disaster. And Magalan had a technological infrastructure that is impossible to recreate.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000085|You mean would Magalan have destroyed itself if the Comet hadn't struck? The Berserkers say so. I disagree.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000084|You think the planet would be better?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000083|You think things would be different?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000082|It's stronger and more durable than its organic cousin, but capable of replicating it. To think what Magalan would have become if the Comet hadn't hit...|Enthusing
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000081|Yes, thank you. An incredible piece of engineering isn't it?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000080|Good, here are the coordinates.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000079|Yes. Let's find your Legate.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000078|I found these on our journey. You can put them to whatever use you see fit.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000077|Do you want the location? Are you ready to deliver the components?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000076|I agree. We should deliver them.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000075|I think you should have the full set of the components you were searching for.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000074|Sure, whatever you say.|Not sure what to make of the strange answers he's getting
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000073|He is a Cleric legate from the Hort monastery.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000072|You must speak to my Legate. I must follow his instructions.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000071|All Clerics believe in Kal-ern.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000070|Oh, yes, in Kal-ern we trust.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000069|The God of the Clerics?|Prompting him
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000068|God? What God?|Confused
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000067|Most people remember the name of their god.|Mildly suspicious
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000066|What do you mean?|Confused
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000065|Sure, if you say so.|Mildly suspicious
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000064|Serve and assist. It is Kal-ern who we serve and the Legate is his voice to me. I must follow his instructions. In Kal-ern we trust.|Repeating what he's been told. He has not got the name of the God right due to a software glitch
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000063|Something isn't right about you.|Mildly suspicious
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000062|Serve him?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000061|It was a Legate from the Hort that sent me and he is very knowledgeable. It is my honor and my duty to serve him.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000060|When our mission is complete I can give you the coordinates, but please remember this is a 'secret' mission.|Hiding that he can't remember
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000059|Perhaps, or to Tavar, it's all very secret. But, I can locate the Cleric that sent me.|Having difficulty remembering
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000058|So, we'll need to take these components back to Ignadon?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000057|Me? I am a...what's the word? An advocate.|Hitting a memory problem. It should come across as if he has been 'suggested' to (the Cleric mind power), but in fat it's to do with his programming.
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000056|So, you are a Cleric?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000055|Then we are a step closer. The Cleric who sent me to do this will be pleased.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000054|I have the sensor module.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000053|Do you want to start by telling me what you're doing?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000051|Certainly, every component found is another step towards the liberation of Magalan!|Bold
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000050|Yes, a Type 702 if we can get one, but anything of that sort will be adequate. And, I'll also need a miniature Elex battery, the sort the Albs use in their raiders.|Working through the list
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000049|A hydraulic joint. The sort found in pre-war machines. I should be able to locate that in the scrap piles near the Outlaw forts.|Working through the list
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000048|Maybe, I had thought of that. But, we also need gaurudium. That's a metal found in the Comet crater in Ignadon.|Working through the list
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000047|A high-performance CPU of the type the Albs use. My research suggest the best place to locate that would be out in the war zone in Abessa.|Working through the list
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000046|Yes, I should tell you the full list. I need, we need, a sensor module from the Converter.|Correcting himself to include the player character.
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000045|Yes, you had better save it to your adjutor.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000044|What components are you looking for?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000043|I found this hydraulic joint. Is this the type you need?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000042|Tell me more about the materials you need.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000041|Tell me about the Clerics.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000040|That could prove an interesting statistical comparison to consider while I travel.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000039|Thank you, by killing those mutants you have helped me greatly. And, yourself to a degree. And, I suppose, all of Magalan. Except the Albs. Or the mutants.|Getting caught in a train of thought
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000037|Only this, but I don't suppose I'm really in a position to argue about paying am I?|Calm, understanding
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000036|How much Elexit have you got?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000035|Pay? How much?|Surprised
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000034|Well, thank you again, I will continue on with my task.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000031|All right you can go.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000030|Before you go, you need to pay me.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000029|But, you obviously have the skills I am lacking. So, why don't we work together? We could both benefit from our different skill sets.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000028|It is obvious I cannot defeat them.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000027|That, and an ability to increase their stamina, pain resistance, strength, emotional resistance etcetera that comes from abusing their bodies with vast amounts of Elex.|A quick aside
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000026|My observations, and those of others, show that the Albs' power comes from their technology.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000025|Me? No, I'm not crazy, I hid up here to avoid fighting one group of mutants, I know I can't stop the Albs alone.|Mistaking the player's line and assuming it as literal
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000024|You're going to stop the Albs?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000023|Oh, no. The precise opposite in fact. I need components to help stop the Albs.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000022|You want to build a Converter?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000015|Why does anyone come here? I came here for the Alb technology.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000014|Why did you come here to the Converter?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000013|That would certainly be helpful. Good luck.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000012|I'll get rid of the mutants for you.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000011|And, when those things are capable of tearing me to pieces, I generally observe them very, very carefully.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000010|You say mutation, I say genetic divergence. After the Comet hit, Elex interacted with the indigenous population's DNA and almost overnight - new species resulted.|Informative
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000009|Where are these mutants coming from?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000007|To the search for greater knowledge! And a number of technical items that I'm tasked to find by the Clerics.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000006|On your way where?|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000005|Ah, good, thank you. Then I can be on my way.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000004|The mutants are dead.|
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000003|Waiting.|Calm
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000002|What are you doing up here?|Calm
INFO_GARTMANNI3_00000001|Good day. Just think, if these mutants keep chasing people up here, we'll soon be able to start our own small town.|Cheerful

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006379|Hey, it's not a problem I have with Clerics, okay? Just this one, for some reason.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006378|No idea what moved you to join up with that bunch of sky worshipping assholes, but...hey, I'll stick around and see what happens.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006377|What could go wrong?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006376|Now all I need to do is find a way out, cross kilometers of enemy territory and find out why my brother tried to kill me. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006375|Although I did get to play around with some more interesting machinery back in the Hort.|Edge of nostalgia
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006374|Was. I was trained in the Hort. But, I never got into all the religious stuff. So, it's been good to find a way to keep doing what I do without the need for all that praising and believing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006373|So, you're a Cleric?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006372|I will keep Origin running in good shape while you are gone.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006370|But, if your path leads to Xacor, you will have to go without me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006369|And you helped us to make this dream a reality.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006368|We have found hope for a better life here in Origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006367|I will fight, but I can't follow you into the Ice Lands.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006366|We have to fight.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006365|I was afraid it would come to that. How can I help?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006364|It is almost time. I will attack the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006363|The stories they tell here are enough to know that we have been lucky here so far.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006362|Yes. I can't imagine the things you must have seen during your travels.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006361|Everyone on Magalan is close to losing everything. This is one of the few places that is still peaceful, more or less.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006360|We are still alive, but we are this close from losing everything.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006359|How are things?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006358|Sure, right, okay, but think about what you're doing before you go slaying Albs close to Origin, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006357|His death was necessary.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006356|Well, you should be careful about that sort of thing, we don't want to draw Xacor's attention to Abessa, or to Origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006355|We had a difference of opinion.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006354|That depends, did you kill Elexetor Repox?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006353|How is everything?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006352|But, there are Alb fighting machines reported in Abessa and Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006351|The Albs seems to be reducing their activity in Tavar and Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006350|Do you have any more news?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006349|And we had better stay low.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006348|People run from them because they are still Albs, even if their goals may have changed, they are still Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006347|Yes. I saw them. But they are just patrolling there. They are interested in their survival, not in fighting the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006346|More and more Alb Separatists are showing up on the road connecting the Desert of Tavar and Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006345|Many people have fled into the forests of Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006344|What is the situation here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006343|We must remain vigilant.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006342|It feels like we are in the eye of the storm and everything is about to end.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006341|Well, even with all the fighting we keep having with the Albs and the mutants, it's still obvious that there aren't as many of them as there were.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006340|What can you tell me about the Alb troop movements here in the region during the last few days?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006339|But, his death came as part of a battle to save Ignadon and save Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006338|Bring an end to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006337|Magalan is depending on you both.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006335|Looks like it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006334|Will you fight alongside Thorald?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006333|Yes, I've heard you have been working with Thorald. I have heard reports of Alb troop movements in Xacor. It 's time you moved.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006332|I am preparing to attack the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006331|Here, intact, in profit. Where will you be when the Hybrid blows your ashes into the sky. Take your crazy ideas out of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006330|And where will Tavar be when we win and you weren't with us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006329|I can hardly image that anyone else will do so either.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006328|This isn't courage, it's stupidity. I am not about to throw my life away on some battlefield in the Ice Desert.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006324|But until then, maybe I'll come and watch him take you apart. Have fun out there. I know I will.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006323|Yeah. Or it's a way to piss him off so he decides to come out fighting and kill everything that moves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006322|It's the only way to stop the Hybrid from conquering Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006321|The Ice Palace? And you've found some other lunatics to help you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006320|Our preparations are almost complete, it is almost time to attack the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006319|May Calaan be with you.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006317|I cannot leave here, now that I am the last Judicator of Hort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006316|Then I wish you well. There was a time when I would have pledged you my support, but I cannot join you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006315|I am making preparations to attack the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006314|Sounds like you've learned a lot. Question is what does any of it mean?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006313|We should go on. I won't learn any more here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006312|But, perhaps you father can convince you. He has been waiting to speak to you since you arrived in Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006311|I hope that you too can see the strength of our cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006310|Which one of you convinced Wardek to join your cause?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006309|No one did. Your father chose to join us himself.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006298|Survival? Analyzing...Recommend more effective equipment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006297|Our priorities have changed, U4. A faction offers a chance of survival and to get answers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006296|Commander... Analyzing: Incorrect faction affiliation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006295|No. From now on Ray. Just assume I don't know and don't ask. Okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006294|Well....never taken it too seriously. Well, I have, I just haven't been that good at it. Well, I have, just not dedicated. You know?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006293|No, I don't know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006292|Well, to some people. I mean I'm supposed to be an Outlaw, but...you know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006291|Yeah you've gone and signed your life away to them. That's like, serious shit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006290|Yes, I've joined a Faction.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006289|Well, now that you are one of the Clerics...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006288|Well, now that you are one of the Berserkers...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006287|Well, now that you are one of the Outlaws...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006286|No, I don't know. What are you talking about?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006285|Well, yeah, wow, you've...done the whole...you know?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006284|Yes. That is why I think we could work together.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006283|If you try and survive out here alone, chances are you'll die. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006282|Why did you join one of the Free Peoples' factions?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006281|In any case, I welcome the fact that you have decided to join us Clerics.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006280|No, no problem at all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006279|Then we don't have a problem?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006278|Yes, that is the approach that I have taken too.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006277|I've got to stay alive if I want to learn anything.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006276|Then it is a choice about survival, not so you can learn more about their society?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006275|I wanted to learn the skills they can teach me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006274|I was starting to wonder where your loyalties were, your ambitions seem different from the Free People I have encountered.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006273|Yes, I have.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006272|You are one of the Free People now...you have joined a Faction.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006271|I want to find answers and joining a faction has to help me find them.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006262|There's just one more thing...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006261|Joining the Clerics was an 'interesting' decision, but well... I suppose you know what you are doing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006260|Well, you must have had your reasons, just don't go causing any trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006259|The Outlaws?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006258|Welcome to the Berserkers. I'm glad you chose to become one of us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006257|So, you've joined a Faction?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006256|Yeah, sometimes rules can be bent.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006255|Can you use it though? You are a Berserker.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006254|I know. I have one that I haven't taken to the Pit yet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006253|You think you can keep up with me? I mean, I use a jetpack sometimes.|Hinting at the Berserker not using technology
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006252|Don't worry, I know how to use one of those. I'll keep up with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006251|And we're not going to get where we need to without a jetpack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006229|I've scored some decent loot from these ruins, but you have to search for stuff.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006228|There's hardly anything usable in most of these ruins, they've been picked clean.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006227|The comet hardly left anything standing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006226|Yeah, that's a...ruin all right.|Appraising the ruins.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006225|I have a really bad feeling about this place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006224|Can we get the fuck out of here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006223|I think we had better be careful here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006222|We shouldn't stay here too long.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006221|Not so bad here, is it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006220|My brother loved places like this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006219|You know it's places like this that almost make you forget what a shitbag of a planet we live on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006218|Yeah, this is...nice isn't it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006217|Did you mean to do that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006216|What the fuck?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006215|Really? I mean...shit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006214|Hey, that was great.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006213|Yeah, good job.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006212|We're doing great!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006211|And what the fuck was that supposed to be?|Observing, sneer
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006210|It's no surprise the Old World disappeared. Look at this shit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006209|Well, this is all fucked isn't it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006208|What a fucking wreck.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006207|Right, let's find some trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006206|Now, this is a place we can have some fun.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006205|Okay, now it'll get interesting.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006204|There's got to be some action here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006203|Fucking countryside.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006202|When can we go?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006201|Can we get out of here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006200|Fuck this place, let's find some action.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006195|Shit, that was pretty good.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006194|Cool.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006193| I must remember these ruins, I would like to return to them some day.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006192|We could learn much from these ruins.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006191|The Old World is truly fascinating.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006190|I would have liked to see the Old World as it was before the Comet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006189|I think it's very risky for us to be here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006188|The area here is rather... worrisome.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006187|Are you sure this is a good place for us to be?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006186|This is a dangerous area.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006185|There is a lot to learn here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006184|I would like to return some day.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006183|I must remember this place.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006177|That was remarkable.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006176|Excellent.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006175|I wonder what this place was.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006174|There must have been a lot of civilians living here once.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006173|The things our world has achieved that are now lost to us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006172|What these ruins must have witnessed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006171|This could be dangerous.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006170|Get ready, this place doesn't feel too friendly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006169|We had better be on our guard here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006168|This could be challenging.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006166|Magalan is a truly amazing place.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006127|I can tell you are no longer a true Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006126|A poor choice, strategically.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006110|I've got a bad feeling about this place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006109|Not good. Not good at all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006108|We had better hurry up and get out of here and fast.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006107|We should go, it's dangerous here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006106|This is a nice place.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006102|Why did you do that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006101|That was great.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006100|Not bad.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006099|You did well.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006098|If I am to lead, then you must follow my choices.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006097|Well. The Fort will have to learn it was saboteurs. There is profit in this yet, and I'll find another way to be rid of those bastards in Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006096|You fucking Clerics, I should have known.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006095|If that was true, then your stronghold in Ignadon would have been erased.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006094|They know my history, they know I can lead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006093|Ignadon can burn for all I care.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006092|When the Albs searched for an identity, it was the Hybrid that gave it to them. He gave us all worth through war.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006091|You may have lived your life in thrall to that machine, but the Albs existed before the Hybrid took control.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006090|No, Jax's word is enough to vouch for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006089|Do you want a demonstration?|Hostile
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006088|So, you are the powerful Mage I have heard of.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006087|So, this is her? Well, I hope the stories of her powers are true....|He didn't expect her to be with him.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006086|She' wouldn't have come here otherwise.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006085|For what? Revenge? You brother doesn't want anything to do with you, he sees you as a traitor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006084|The forces of Xacor are preparing for something. We should expect an attack soon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006083|A few days ago maybe? Kallax was ordered back to the Ice Palace|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006082|When did you last see my brother?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006081|But, then you and Kallax never were the squeamish sort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006080|The past is done, we must look forward to the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006079|Sorry about that, I'm feeling pretty bad about that right now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006078|Sounds like you really could use that armor I took from you, yeah?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006056|But, Warlord Ragnar liked him. He was very dutiful.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006055|He left the other Cultivators behind when he was promoted. Talked to the Warriors like he knew best.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006054|He only believed in hierarchy and rank.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006053|No idea. One of the Cultivators, or one of the other Warriors maybe?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006052|Who else could have had a problem with Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006051|Well, don't look at me. I'm happy where I am. I don't give a troll's ass about promotion.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006050|Ambition could give a motive. If he got in someone's way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006049|But, he was sort of ambitious and that sometimes...well it made him an ass. Listen, it doesn't matter, just forget what I said.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006048|He was my friend. Our parents were friends. We basically grew up as brothers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006047|Well, he wasn't a simple guy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006046|Your friend Askor... What kind of man was he?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006045|We are Free People now and won't replace ruler with another.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006044|It is for each Alb to decide. And for now we have decided to take it. We have to stand by their decision.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006043|Can't you give up Elex if it would help you join another faction?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006042|You are probably a soldier from Xacor. Possibly even... a Commander?|Assessing the player character.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006041|I know who you were, Commander, but look at you now. Drained of Elex, out of Xacor. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006039|Yes, Fenk... It's me, Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006038|You both were on the battlefield fighting the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006037|It was a long time ago...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006036|When did you last see Elexetor Kallax?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006035|I suppose our only other choice would be to kill you. And if we kill everyone we doubt, then we would still be Albs. Don't make the wish we had killed you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006034|We have to trust you and hope you don't betray us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006033|You doubt their motives. Death will do that to a man. 'To a man'...if that's what we both are now.|Reflecting on the changes in them both
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006032|You don't have a choice.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006031|I don't owe the Elexetors anything.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006030|But, how are we to persuade them, if we can't get you on our side? Are we able to trust you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006029|They can accept it, they must. It is in their best interests.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006028|The Outlaws have their chems, the Berserkers their Mana, how can this be seen as different.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006027|Keep taking Elex and the Free People will see you as Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006026|We're helping each other. We're keeping our strength and our freewill.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006025|Would I speak out against the Elexetors if it wasn't true?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006024|You really think you're in control?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006023|Yes. We don't want to poison ourselves anymore. We still take it, but we control it, it doesn't control us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006022|You really want to give up Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006021|Where nearby?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006020|Where do you go when you do get away?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006019|He deals with that sort of thing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006018|Talk to my cousin William.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006017|And you shall prosper.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006016|Prove your loyalty to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006015|So, you have joined us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006014|But, all this is easy to talk of, harder, much harder for you to achieve.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006013|Each rank comes with its rewards.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006012|You'll start as a Runner, but prove loyal and you can become an Enforcer, maybe even a Captain.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006011|But, if you join us, you will swear loyalty to me for good.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006010|I want to get some of the armor you have here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006009|They've made their name.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006008|Big mouths weed people out quickly. Many people like to say who they are and what they can do. The Fort quickly finds out if they can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006007|How have other people become Outlaws?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006006|Dream a pretty, little dream.|Mocking
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006005|Yeah. You can sit there, take some chems and dream.|Mocking
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006004|Isn't there another way?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006003|Get your fucking ass out of here and get it fucking done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006002|You can get the job done that I've given you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006001|How can I join the Outlaws?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00006000|The Ice Palace is gathering its strength. If you ask me we should prepare ourselves for a large-scale attack soon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005998|His troops moved through a pass to the north in the highlands of Abessa a few day ago.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005997|Reconnaissance. We're gathering information on the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005996|But, it was the same in Xacor. There have been changes since the Elexetors took control of the courts of the Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005995|You were probably a victim of those changes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005994|The Albs in Xacor want us dead as traitors, the Free People don't know what to make of us. We're surrounded by threat on all sides.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005992|What exactly is your job out here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005991|Do you know Kallax's current location?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005990|There is change in Xacor. Troops being withheld, commanders changed. Orders aren't following the precision we were used to.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005989|But, I'm alive... and I want answers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005988|I fell from a cliff when he shot me. Kallax must have thought he'd done his job.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005987|My raider was shot down, Kallax was there at the crash site. He carried out the Directive, execution of those who fail orders.|Reliving the moment
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005986|When have the Elexetors ever allowed people to stop taking Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005985|Look at me. Do I look like I'm taking Elex? Why would I sacrifice that strength and then try and kill you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005984|Then what did happen? Why would they try and execute you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005983|You wouldn't be alive right now if I was taking orders from Xacor. And you know that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005982|Have you ever heard of a failed execution? What was the real plan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005981|You expect me to buy that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005980|No plan. They really tried to kill me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005979|They tried but they weren't exactly successful, as you see.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005978|Infiltrate somewhere undercover?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005977|We were told you were executed. You failed your mission and execution was carried out in the field. What was the real plan? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005976|Hear? You mean, what other lies did they sell us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005975|What else did you hear about me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005974|No, it seems you can't be trusted even in death.|Suspiious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005973|So they say.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005972|Failure is not tolerated... It is against the Directive...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005971|But, executions end with death. Assumption. Commander must be using rare example of Alb humor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005970|Yes... I'm joking U4. I mean who would want to kill the great Commander Jax?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005969|Analyzing... Negative. Executions are standard Alb operating procedure for mission failure...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005968|Then you don't know anything about my execution...?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005967|System error...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005965|My objectives were to complete the mission, or return to base.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005964|This unit was offline for 1043 seconds. On recovery, U4 could not locate the Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005963|Why did you leave the crash site?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005962|Mh... That somehow means everything... and nothing at the same time...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005961|Probability of Berserker participation low...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005960|Analyzing... The ground fire was from an energy weapon. Not magical in origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005959|What about the Berserkers? They would have at least had a motive to shoot me down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005957|Negative...Commanding unit status - privileges revoked. Execution ordered as a result of mission failure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005956|Well. That was a success, huh?|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005952|Status report of our last mission goals.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005951|Cannot state probability...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005950|Analyzing... Capabilities and behavior of the Outlaws difficult to calculate...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005949|Could the Outlaws have been responsible for the shooting?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005948|Calculations indicate... low probability of Cleric participation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005947|Analyzing... Flight was over Berserker territory... Clerics did not have much reason to defend the primary mission goal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005946|You mean it could have been the Clerics who shot at us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005945|But, there are some answers out there somewhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005944|Identity of shooter...unknown.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005943|Analyzing....Motive unknown.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005942|I was told it was faulty. Why would our own people sabotage the mission?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005941|Status of open port on the raider was unusual. Port could only have been opened and secured in place during maintenance in Alb repair station.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005940|Analyzing... Possible indications that an Elex-powered weapon was used... Albs use Elex-operated weapons...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005939|Albs too? What exactly do you mean?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005938|There were no indications of magic... possible responsible parties: the Outlaws, Clerics... or Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005937|Analyzing... Cannot positively identify...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005936|Where did the fire come from exactly?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005935|The raider was hit by accurate ground fire. The shot hit an open port on the raider. Evasion was not possible...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005934|Analyzing... The raider was on a direct approach to the primary mission goal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005933|What data do you have on the crash?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005932|Now, there is a future that Magalan should be fighting for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005931|Then good, honest warriors, could go back to sleeping in nice, comfortable beds.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005930|Maybe he will figure out how to rob the Albs of their magical strength, at least.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005929|Meaning if anyone actually knows no one is actually saying.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005928|Well, that is confidential.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005927|Where is Pilgrim Thorald?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005925|But, nobody is really allowed to talk about it. But, then nobody even really understands what he is doing anyway.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005924|It is something huge, that would change the war and all of Magalan. Bzoowww, you think it, it happens, the Albs are screwed. Bzoow, just like that. No idea what it is though.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005923|Not much. It's said that he is working on a plan to stop the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005922|What do you know about Thorald's retreat?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005921|Still, whatever, I've heard he's retreated into study. Let him play with his magic, I hope it does save us, and while he's away I have my peace and quiet out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005919|When he was still the big boss up there in Goliet he used to reprimand me, quite often. I wondered if he was still keeping an eye on me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005918|What makes you think Thorald, the Pilgrim sent me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005917|Well, you know, it's not really like the Albs are going to attack these trees is it? If there's one thing the Albs know we've got a lot of, it's trees.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005916|Tavar is growing while all the other factions fight amongst themselves and that is down to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005915|After the Albs they gave birth to come home to destroy them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005914|While we grow, day-by-day, they are dying in their stronghold. Soon, we will pick the bones of the Hort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005913|They know nothing about profit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005912|Who talk of technology, but worship superstition?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005911|And, the Clerics?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005910|Well. And we don't even have to talk about those Albs. They are just completely crazy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005909|He's hiding in the mountains while they grub around in the dirt.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005908|They don't even know where their leader has gone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005907|The Berserkers and their Pilgrim?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005906|What about them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005905|What about the other Factions?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005904|You must judge the man by his achievements. When he has completed his retreat, I am certain you will understand what our world owes him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005903|You met him? Well, then you are truly honored. He might not be a man of many words, but that is because he is focused on his task.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005902|If he didn't wish to talk, it is because of the work he is undertaking.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005901|I met Thorald. He wasn't exactly communicative.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005900|His knowledge of magic is superior to anyone's. If there is any person capable of solving the problems we face, it is the Pilgrim.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005899|He has taken it upon himself to go into Retreat to seek the answers we need for Edan to survive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005898|Thorald is not here at the moment. The Warlords are in charge of the day-to-day running, though all owe their allegiance to him, the Pilgrim.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005897|Master Thorald... What kind of man is he?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005896|The Pilgrim has been gone for so long I'm not sure anyone knows where he is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005895|All we know is that his leaving has something to do with Elex and Mana.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005894|But, what, exactly...? I don't think anyone knows.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005893|He announced that he needed to go into retreat for some higher purpose and that was it. He left.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005892|Where can I find this Master Thorald?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005891|It's time Master Thorald returned from his retreat to put this right, but...just like everyone else, it seems like he has plans greater than say...making sure everyone gets fed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005890|Okay, I've got it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005889|Until then, he has given Warlord Ragnar command of Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005888|He will return as soon as his mission is successful.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005887|No. Master Thorald, the Pilgrim, glorious, great and wise, has gone into retreat. There he seeks answers. From there he will return to bring us victory.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005886|So, your leader Thorald is not in the city?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005885|His is the grave duty of overseeing the war against the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005884|If you have any intelligence that might help him in this duties you will find him in the upper halls of the Cathedral.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005883|Judicator Ulbricht is responsible for the defense of Edan and all operations outside its borders.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005882|May Calaan have mercy on his soul.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005881|Judicator Johann fell on the battlefield. His is the highest honor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005880|Tell me about the other Judicators.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005879|You can find him and Judicator Ulbricht in the Cathedral. The large building at the rear of the Hort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005878|Judicator Reinhold takes care of prospective Acolytes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005877|Who do I speak to about joining the Clerics?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005876|We only have Judicator Ulbricht's war strategy to thank for the fact that Hort hasn't been overrun by our enemies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005875|Badly. We have lost a lot of good men out there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005874|How is the fight going against the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005873|Just go through the stairs by the lava pit. He is usually up there somewhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005872|Mh... The man you are looking for is Hagen.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005871|Do you offer any sort of training here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005869|I hope we can find more people to stand and fight beside them.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005868|Our Mechs hold back the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005867|The Hort holds and protects Old World knowledge. We, the Clerics have kept it, developed it and hold it in trust for all Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005866|You have a lot of machines here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005865|And, all who are here follow Calaan. His wisdom guides us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005864|They are served by the Paladins, Legates and Acolytes here in the Hort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005863|You will find them at the rear of the stronghold, in the Cathedral.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005862|Our Judicators Reinhold and Ulbricht.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005861|Who is in charge here at the Hort?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005860|Gladly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005859|Will you trade me some Mana for Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005858|If we weren't so busy here, we'd've tracked them down and cleared them out of Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005857|I don't know what they want in the city. I'd heard a bunch of them had set up a base in the west of Abessa so they could've gone there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005856|You want to go chasing after your old boss, that's up to you. I hope you manage to kill each other. Just don't bring the trouble here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005855|So, let me give you a warning, that approach is going to get you and anyone close to you killed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005854|Don't treat me like a rookie, you sound like someone who wants a showdown.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005853|I'm asking so I can avoid them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005852|You go chasing them, you'll just find trouble. And, I don't want them tracing that trouble back here.|Giving advice
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005851|What's with the interest in Elexetors?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005850|A few days ago. They must be back at the Ice Palace in Xacor by now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005849|Elexetor' Kallax? So, he's been promoted... Tell me, how long ago did 'Elexetor' Kallax head north?|Realising the new title
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005848|Elexetor Kallax was reported to have headed north with a few combat units and a troop of mechs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005847|Yeah, yeah, I have now that you mention it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005846|But, have you heard anything about Elexetors travelling through Abessa?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005845|But, they don't seem to be attacking us here for the moment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005844|With Xacor on our northern border? There are always Alb troops coming through on their way somewhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005843|Have there been any Albs attacks here recently?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005842|A strong sword, our very effective combat magic and a strong will those will save the world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005841|They will stop the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005840|To destroy Magalan as you destroy your soul?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005839|Is that what you want?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005838|Then you would be just another henchman. A soulless puppet for their cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005837|What if I did and I took Elex as well?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005836|Have you got them? A fighting spirit? A will to win?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005835|But, true power is only found in the will to win and the fighting spirit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005834|Pah... A fully trained Alb Commander, even an Elexetor, they may be powerful...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005833|It almost sounds like you envy the Albs' power.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005832|He died. It was all just too much. I wish I could have learned more from him. If he could leave, so could others. Maybe, that could offer hope to us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005831|What happened to him? Where is he?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005830|All that pain, all that confusion.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005829|He was trying to cope with all those withdrawal symptoms and at the same time, he was rediscovering his emotions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005828|His external wounds weren't so bad, but internally...emotionally...|Feeling sympathetic for their prisoner and his pain.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005827|I met an Alb Separatist, he was brought in as a prisoner.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005826|What do you know about Elex withdrawal?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005825|I wish I could meet one. Knowing what they feel might help me assist others to overcome their addiction.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005824|Yes. They say Elex makes machines of men. But, I have heard there are Albs who have escaped their addiction.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005823|Hurt, yes, but they're trained to reject emotions and feelings.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005822|It's more destructive. With the damage it's causing I can't believe it isn't tearing the Albs apart too. It must hurt them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005821|It's more powerful than Berserker magic?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005820|The magic the Albs are using is so destructive. Somehow they're managing to use pure Elex and...it makes me fear for our warriors.|Concerned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005819|I don't need to hear, I get to see the results.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005818|You must hear a lot about what's going on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005817|There were a few Warriors, but we lost them in the last attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005816|Not that are still alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005815|Do you know anyone who made it all the way to the Ice Palace?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005814|Hardly anyone who has seen the Ice Palace has returned alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005813|I don't really get any news from past the first border region up there in the highlands of Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005812|There's not many Berserkers prepared to venture far into the Ice Lands.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005811|Do you know where in the north he's gone?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005810|Must've had a fright, there've been no more Albs seen since then.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005809|He and his troops went north. Pity, he made it out just before the force sent after him got there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005808|Kallax?... Do you know where he is now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005807|One of them Albs, Kallax, they say, seemed to be very interested in the old observatory in the mountains up there to the west.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005806|Well, it's said that they were very active a few days ago.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005805|Have you heard anything about the Albs recently?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005803|So, right, there you are. Does that cover it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005802|What with the Alb attacks and the Clerics stealing our stuff, I think we're getting ready to show them we shouldn't be fucked with.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005801|And, you know, they all make shards, so we all make shards. And, there's talk about plans. Plans to make the Fort something big.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005800|I mean just the other day I met a bounty hunter here who was trying to track down and Outlaw over something. Trust me, you want to stay away from that life and that merchandise.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005799|I'm a brave man, but no Outlaw, no reaver. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005797|Alb tech is far, far too hot in Goliet, my friend.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005796|Can you get hold of Alb technology?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005795|Maybe they don't like the Mana. The mutants here love it, but when they eat it it makes them sick. Maybe, the Albs can sense that and want to stay healthy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005794|You'd think they'd come straight for it, hey? It's eating Elex and they sort of want all the Elex don't they?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005793|They don't come here, they, bypass it, keeping their distance. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005792|What do you mean the Albs don't 'register' the World Heart?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005791|Interesting to know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005790|Straight to Tavar and a share of the profit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005789|Well, if they're true Outlaws there is only one place they'll take them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005788|And, do you know where they take the things they've stolen?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005787|Outlaws, the one thing you can trust them to do, is to steal things.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005786|No guards for escorting the supplies here, or to distribute them afterwards. Outlaws and Clerics stealing some of what we do send.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005785|Yes, it's not just you. I had my armor stolen by an Outlaw.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005784|It sounds like these supply problems are getting you down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005783|No, which does make you wonder who it could have been.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005782|No, no way. If someone from here had done that, they'd've had a parade. And, they'd never have stopped talking about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005781|Was it a Berserker that shot the raider down?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005780|Machines are against nature.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005779|You see what comes of them when it crashes out of the sky.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005778|Nobody would get ME into one of those infernal machines, at any rate.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005777|No. Something went phoom on the thing and down it went. Whatever happened, happened quick. Goes to show, relying on technology is pure madness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005776|And did you see who shot the raider down?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005775|Sure, I had a ringside seat here. Whoosh, blam! Serves the bastard right, flying round up there, raining shit on other people. Got some of his own shit back from someone didn't he?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005774|Did you see the Alb raider crash?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005773|With Albs crawling round in the undergrowth ever since that raider crashed out to the west!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005772|What? What's the problem? You didn't die? Oh no, you destroyed my masterpiece instead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005771|You destroyed it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005770|Yes. Who knows what it would have destroyed if he had gotten away with it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005769|That contraption was Konrad's thing. I didn't have anything to do with it, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005768|Hey. I heard somebody destroyed Konrad's Big Bang. Is that true?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005767|Did you know the truth? That it was a combat robot and not a bomb?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005766|I have not been caught out like that for a long time.|Dour
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005765|He was pretty damned convincing. |Dour
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005764|And you believed Konrad would destroy his own kind?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005763|With them gone, we'd control all the technology this side of Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005762|And with the Clerics gone. The Albs should take care of the Berserkers for me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005761|The balance of power.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005760|It's not like those Berserkers want it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005759|Why did you want to destroy the Hort?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005758|And, everyone in Tavar knows I am the only one who can guarantee them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005757|Those are the laws of the wasteland.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005756|Survival of the fittest.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005755|Liberty.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005754|Profit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005753|Everyone here is free.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005752|Do you see any more indiscipline than there is in the other factions?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005751|Do you see any real problems out there?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005750|Everyone here has decided to be here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005749|Those are the laws of Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005748|It must be difficult keeping a city like this together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005725|Yes.|Surprised he knows this
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005724|Okay, that is one argument.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005723|You know the price that an Alb pays to reach the highest ranks in Xacor|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005722|Someone at the Ice Palace planned this. A faulty raider, a targeted shot, Kallax arriving so fast? The question is, who planned for me to fail? Who planned for me to die?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005721|But, those ruins are dangerous, the Rotboars might still be there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005720|But, for me, if Magalan is to survive, every life must count.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005719|So, you think the value of life is decided by the style of armor it wears?|Unimpressed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005714|It appears to be connected to another near the Hort in Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005713|This teleporter is active.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005712|And here we go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005711|Listen to him if you must, but take this Seedling into the chamber with you. You must attach it to the Hybrid. That is how we will tame him, or kill him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005710|So, why not tell Ragnar that Askor had killed the Seedling?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005709|Not now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005708|Not now, you should go and do the things you have to do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005707|Not now, I have things to consider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005706|Not now. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005705|Analyzing conversational parameters....Analysis complete, I have nothing to say.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005704|Not now, you should deal with the things you have to do..|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005703|There is an abandoned camp in some ruins to the west of Goliet. You can meet me there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005702|Oh....look who is here!|Referring to Falk
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005701|Says the guy who got stuck on top of a Converter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005700|These components are important, we should deliver them quickly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005699|Just think of the things I can achieve if this allows me to live forever.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005698|And, that's the full list?|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005688|Then go. But, U4 you are not to report on my status. If asked about me, State that I died in the crash. I will meet you at the repair station in Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005687|Yes, well, I'll look forward to that then.|Less than convinced
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005686|I will speak to you then.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005685|I thought we was traveling with you. I don't know where he is now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005684|Have you see Wardek, my father?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005682|Well, you're here and they lied about you...I don't know what the others at headquarters think about you, but...|Wary, assessing him.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005681|You're on the outside too now, Jax. Xacor will see you as a Separatist just like us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005680|So, you believe me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005679|Our headquarters are located at the Converter in South Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005678|If you need more information then speak to Sestak. He's at our headquarters in the Converter in South Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005677|Thanks for the warning.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005676|They will kill you and have your stuff on the black market before your body hits the ground. They haven't made us welcome, that's for sure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005675|There are Outlaws roaming around out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005674|I'd better get back to guard duty.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005672|You should speak with our leader, Sestak.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005671|So, we're hearing still hearing news from Xacor. Your name has been dropped, dishonored and another commander has taken your place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005670|So, if you want to stay alive, I guess you're stuck with us. Xacor won't forget you were sentenced for execution. That makes us allies of circumstance if nothing else.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005669|I've only just started thinking. In Xacor. I was a drone, an Elex fed soldier. They didn't tell me anything. Now, I'm just a soldier and without the Elex to dull me I get to be pissed that I wasn't told anything!|Making a joke about his new emotions.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005668|What do you think is happening?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005667|For all I wouldn't have believed that a few months ago, that story fits with other things that I have seen and heard.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005666|I told you, speak to Sestak. He's at our headquarters in the Converter in South Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005665|Almost every day, we get a new stream of soldiers and officers defecting to us.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005663|Wait? Is that you, Jax? I thought you were dead!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005662|Halt! Who goes there?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005661|Very well. If that's what you wish.|Disappointed

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005659|A charging station. But, for what?|Considering what he can see
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005658|... System error... Standard protocol outside of allowed parameters...I will require a replacement companion.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005654|... Our companionship is calibrated positively.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005653|... Our companionship appears to have reached its optimal calibration.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005652|Analyzing...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005651|For Magalan's people to survive, we alone must have control.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005650|The Free People must bow to us. They all talk of liberty, or saving Magalan, but only Albs can offer salvation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005649|Magalan belongs to the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005648|That can't go on for long. The Ice Palace must know they are going to get new resources soon. They must have plans to remedy this shortage.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005647|Now, Xacor is using Elex and harvesting almost none.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005646|If that happens, we'd better not be standing where that blow falls. Let the Free People die while we take care of our own business.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005645|The most obvious answer is that troops are being mustered for a major attack.|Realising
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005644|The Hybrid should use Elex for better purposes not waste it on the battlefield. He talks of the future so why are we focused on the present?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005643|This war is a waste of valuable resources.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005642|Something must have happened in the Ice Palace since I was last there. The question is what...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005641|Alb attacks on the Free People have decreased.|Observing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005640|It is best for you if we never cross paths again...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005639|Magalan cannot afford more weakness. Whatever the future, it demands strength.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005638|You are a traitor to the Alb you were.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005637|Loyalty is not without end, Commander. I can't stand by you if you continue with these weaknesses. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005636|Your logic, your strength, they have deserted you. Sentiment and emotion might win you 'friends', but they won't get the job done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005635|Let us see if you can find your old strength.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005633|I see the old Commander in you, the Albt you once were. There is hope for you yet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005632|Doubt that and you will lose both yourself and the future that was destiny for you. Heed my advice.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005631|Elex withdrawal. You lose yourself when you lose your connection to your brothers. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005630|You seem emotional. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005629|That will impair your judgement.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005627|Your judgement is impaired. You're thinking like a Free Person.|Disdain.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005626|If you don't behave more like an Alb, there is no point me continuing with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005625|The way we work together is proving efficient. You are almost worthy of admiration.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005624|Your actions have proven to be valid. Our partnership should continue.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005623|You are not the Commander you were in Xacor. Your Elex withdrawal must be affecting you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005622|You have proven to be moderately reliable. Remembering that you are an Alb would make you more efficient.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005621|How do you think we are doing working together?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005620|Those qualities are clear in you, Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005619|You are efficient, determined. You have a keen mind.|Listing the player character's qualities.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005617|Yes, we will have a lot to do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005616|I assume you have new orders from the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005615|Your progress, has been impressive.|Paying a compliment
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005614|The Hybrid has changed, you will see a difference in him from now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005613|What I once believed, now I know. The Hybrid is all powerful. He will lead us into the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005612|For all his power, he couldn't stop a single, renegade Alb.|Angry with himself.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005611|But, now...now things feel different.|Coming to terms with the fact that something has changed (see options below)
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005610|The invincible Hybrid. Omnipotent, all knowing.|Annoyed with himself
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005609|It was... interesting, being at your side... Perhaps we will see each other again under different circumstances.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005608|I will have to leave you, otherwise both of us will come to a bad end.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005607|I have made a decision.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005606|I hope that feeling fades, because if not I will have to leave you to go my own way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005605|I am unhappy. I find it difficult to understand many of the things you do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005604|I think travelling with you should prove to be very instructive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005603|You are a very interesting person. You are hiding many secrets. That is plain even if the secrets aren't.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005602|Although, I have observed that many people achieve their goals despite acting impulsively and irrationally.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005601|And you seem to have learned from what you've seen. Many of your decisions appear to be logical.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005599|Developing a logical understanding of what happens around you is a worthwhile goal. It is easier to understand the world when you see it reacting to something. It certainly reacts to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005598|But, emotions give you the power of rage and aggression, they can block your progress, or give you the necessary strength to reach your goals more easily.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005597|People say that good deeds always have good results.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005596|Having strong emotions can be a blessing, or a curse, both for those experiencing them and for anyone nearby.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005595|There is still so much to discover. Now that the war is over, it should be much easier for us to explore and gather that data.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005594|The machines of the Ice Palace are powerful adversaries. You should only meet them in battle if you are well armed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005593|The Albs are the enemy. People must take care that they are not overrun and fed into their converters.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005592|The data we are gathering should be really useful, for something.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005591|There is still so much to discover. It will be interesting to see what comes next.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005590|Travelling with you is a truly fascinating experience. You have taught me much, I hope to continue learning with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005589|Thank you, I am starting to understand Magalan much more clearly now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005588|The majority of our experiences have led me to believe that this whole world is...confusing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005587|I am finding both you and our experiences to be...challenging.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005586|It is hard to say right now. Let me think further.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005585|How are you doing, Falk?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005584|It is true that death should not be celebrated. But, it is clear that the people of Magalan will be better of for it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005583|I did not expect you to assist the Hybrid, but the results are quite fascinating.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005582|The fact you taught it emotion is fascinating. It will be interesting to see what happens next. With their common enemy gone, will the factions unite? What will the Hybrid become? I am intrigued to find out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005581|You defeated the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005580|But, whatever happens next, you are now part of Magalan's great history.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005579|You killed the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005578|It's remarkable what one person can achieve.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005577|I hope you find your way back from the path you've chosen, or the next time we meet, it may be as enemies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005576|Find your own way without me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005575|You dishonor me. I can't travel with you any longer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005574|I am telling you: Leave this path or you will lose my respect and my help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005573|What is it that you think is honorable about ignoring your own comrades?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005572|They will speak of our deeds long after we have gone. You have carved a name in history.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005571|The Ice Palace must fall. Otherwise, we will all lose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005570|Ever since the Albs set up their base in the Ice Palace, they have been killing to take land and to feed their Converters. But now they're after more than just Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005569|There's a war coming. Something is happening in Xacor and I know it will bring danger to us all. We will have to stop it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005568|A true warrior carries his weapons with pride.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005567|You should be a warrior, a helper of the Free People with your talent. And yet you act like a reaver.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005566|Rational, logical, without honor, or real pride. You're a waste of your talents. You're turning your back on honor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005565|Who would've thought it? From wanderer to Warrior. You should be proud of yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005564|The Berserkers have held the Albs back with bravery and magic. This fight will call upon those qualities.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005563|I'd be better if I didn't always have to watch my own back...I need to know you will back me, not just in battle, but in your choices.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005562|I can go on, but I have to know... Are we going to work together? Some of your decisions, well, I wouldn't have made them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005561|We're a team. I'm ready if you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005560|Two experienced fighters like us, I feel like there is nothing we cannot do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005559|Great warriors like us. Whatever waits, we will be victorious.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005558|Do you think we make a good team, Duras? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005557|That may be. But, after seeing what you have achieved, I believe anything is possible.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005556|The war is over, but that just opens the door to other challenges.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005555|Yes. The Hybrid will help us to bring the remaining Albs into line.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005554|And, now you've climbed so far, what will you do now? Will you let the Free People live in peace?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005553|Your courage has brought the world to this place. Magalan owes you. I bow my head in thanks on behalf of all Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005552|You defeated the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005551|You liberated us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005550|You might not be a Berserker, but....|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005549|From a lost sheep to a wolf.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005548|All right ... maybe, I just didn't want to leave all the glory to you? What do you think, you can name us joint saviors of Magalan, yeah?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005547|Right.|Not believing it
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005546|Yeah, I guess I just couldn't leave you, you're just that charismatic.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005545|You're alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005544|Home? It's a monument to violence and death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005543|That fortress was my home.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005542|Main thing is ... we're still alive!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005541|It's still alive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005540|The Hybrid isn't dead, he is changing, evolving.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005539|How did you get out of the fortress alive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005538|You've changed the world.|Impressed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005537|You just walk into the fortress and finish off that creature.? |Impressed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005536|You're a daredevil, you know that?|Impressed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005535|You go your way, I'll go mine. Just...just don't shoot me when I do, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005534|But, right now, I know this isn't working.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005533|Well, maybe I shouldn't have thrown in with you in the first place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005532|Make your mind up, because the way you're behaving, keep doing that and I'm out of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005531|Look, do you want me here, or not?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005530| You might not be taking Elex, but you're still definitely 100% Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005529|You can be proud.|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005528|Albs, Clerics, Berserkers, and we're all one species, can you believe that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005527|Being shot out of the sky did you some good.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005526|You know, for an Alb, you're practically a person, you know that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005525|Tell me what comes next is going to be easier. I know it's a lie, but just tell me that, so I can pretend, okay? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005524|If I'm watching your back and you're watching mine, then who's watching what's out there?|Making a joke
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005523|You know, I prefer it when the Albs stay in Xacor. They like it there, we like them there, can't we just all agree on that and go home?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005522|Well, life doesn't get dull with you around. It's worth sticking with you just to see who's going to get killed next.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005521|We shouldn't hang around here too long. Staying in one place is never a good idea.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005520|Yeah, sure. It's like being in an Outlaw gang again. I'm wondering whether you're going to kill me before anyone else does.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005519|Are you sure they're okay, because I'm not.|Unenthused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005518|I don't know, you tell me. I mean you've not tried to kill me, so that's got to be good, right?|Nervous
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005517|Hey, you're alive, I'm alive, that's got to be good right?|Positive

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005515|Is everything okay with us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005514|You think I wanted your help? I don't ask anyone for help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005513|Your disease is tragic, but I cannot help you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005512|Or, is this about making sure I don't try and fight Parsek alone?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005511|Is this about looking at my ass...?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005510|I guess...I'll have to make something happen.|It's about a romance with Nasty.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005509|What is going on right now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005508|Be honest. You don't have any idea what's going on right now, do you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005507|Fuck all, it seems. So, make your mind up. Are you going to make something happen, or stand there waiting until I get bored and leave?|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005501|So, are you fucking her, or what?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005500|You'd better not be expecting me to do all the work.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005498|If, I'm serious? Fuck you know how to ruin a moment.|Softening...we don't want to make her girly girly, but have to match the romantic animation
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005497|Fine, you don't like random comments.|Getting to it
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005496|I'm an asshole? You're the one that comes out with random comments and then gets pissed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005495|But, whatever, fuck it, or go fuck yourself. Let's get on with your great mission.|Resigned/annoyed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005494|Complicated? This is sex, not us moving in together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005493|Maybe later, all right? Fuck you know how to make a girl feel shit. But, whatever, fuck it, or go fuck yourself. Let's get on with your great mission.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005492|Maybe later, all right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005491|No. That would make things too complicated.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005486|You mean since I left Xacor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005485|Have you travelled with other people as well?|Fishing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005484|I'm not used to this shit.|Feeling some attachment, building up to saying it, awkward
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005483|Hah! Right, okay.... Well, don't think I came along because of your ass. It's a seven at best. Maybe eight in a good light. Right. Well, stop staring at me and let's get on with this, asshole.|Breaking the tension, relaxed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005482|Forget the Albs. It's really about your ass. I'm bringing the Free People together because of your ass.|Joking
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005481|Okay. Right. Good then. Glad that's clear. Well? Stop staring at me and let's get on with this, asshole.|Calming, but feeling like she's not had an answer.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005480|I don't care about your brother, this is about Magalan.|Business like
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005479|I've met your type before and they try to get close to me to get close to my brother. Or, because they think I am some sort of trophy fuck.|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005478|If you'd pissed me off, I wouldn't be here. If you'd 'really' pissed me off I wouldn't be here. But, you do piss me off!|Rebuttal. Correction stress on 'really', getting annoyed again.

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005473|So, cut the Magalan stuff and tell me what you really want.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005472|So, why pick me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005471|I didn't drag you anywhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005470|You started this. You turned up. You went through those fights. You dragged me out of Tavar.|Reciting their relationship
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005469|What started this?|Wary bloke being asked about emotions
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005468|But, what the fuck is it that you really want?|But not about himself. Stress on 'you'
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005467|Magalan, Albs, blah, blah.|As in he's told her about the overall plan.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005466|I've told you that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005465|What exactly is your game? What is it you want?|Starting a 'deep and meaningful' conversation. Wary as she fishes to find out his intentions.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005464|I'm out of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005463|But, congratulations, you just took the prize.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005462|I thought I'd met some total fuck-ups in life. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005461|You get that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005460|Get your shit sorted, or I'm out of here. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005459|You really are an Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005458|Cold, brutal, effective.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005457|Emotions get you hurt. Not giving a shit gets you nothing. It's a fucked up world we live in.|Observation
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005456|It's about time. Use that emotion. Use that anger.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005455|Who pissed in your stream? Looks like Magalan's finally getting you angry.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005454|There must be more of those fuckers out there somewhere. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005453|Whatever this god does for them, it certainly helps these Clerics fight. You'd almost think there were Outlaws.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005452|Something's going on at the Ice Palace. Whatever it is, we need to shut it down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005451|Here comes the pride of Xacor. High on Elex and ready to be taken down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005450|Alb warriors, Alb fighting skill, if they're so good, where the fuck are they?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005449|Never mind the bullshit, let's kill something.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005448|You know, when I first met you, I thought you'd just fuck around. |Happy Banter
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005447|Why don't you go get fucked. I've had enough of your shit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005446|Are you going to get your shit together? Think about those decisions you're making and sort it out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005445|Yeah, yeah, whatever, let's get on with it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005444|Us? Well, you're a dickhead, but we make a good team.|Happy Banter
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005443|Butterflies and honey. Stop being so soppy and let's get the job done you asswipe.|Banter
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005442|Well, I guess you're built out of tougher stuff than the Duke. Shit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005441|So you say, but I'm not serving that monster.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005440|The Hybrid work has only just begun. That work must not be put at risk.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005439|You had it at your mercy? Why didn't you just kill the damn thing?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005438|No, the Hybrid is still alive, he surrendered to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005437|Is that Alb freak finally gone?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005436|The Hybrid is dead.|Confirming
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005435|Is that Alb freak finally gone?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005434|So, you actually did it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005433|Everything okay with us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005432|It's not here, not physically here, it's where we are. The two of us. Our feelings.|Working her way up to it. Hinting at emotions
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005431|Don't worry, you're not doing too badly for an Alb. You'll get there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005430|Yes. We are closer than I thought we'd be.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005429|Yes...here we are. What's so special about here?|Not understanding the emotions
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005428|When we met, I thought, well, I didn't know what to think of you. A chancer, someone else out for what they could get, but...here we are.|Nervous. This is triggered when they come closer. Sort of romance.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005426|You deserve each other... |A little sour
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005425|Well, she seems to be good match for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005424|Yes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005423|You are with Nasty now, aren't you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005422|Yes... Um... I...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005421|I am glad you see it that way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005420|But, it feels like it's more than that.|Hoping
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005419|You were connected to the other Albs then forced to be alone. Unconnected.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005418|I'm worried that might be why we get on so well, that you're just looking for something to replace that connection.|Fishing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005417|That must feel strange?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005416|You mean you know me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005413|Oh, well, then...just...just forget what I said then.|Upset. Thrown by the honesty
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005412|No, you are mistaken.|Straight
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005411|Well, good. Then...|Thrown by the honesty
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005410|Yes, it's true.|Straight
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005409|Please, tell me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005408|Is that true?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005407|That you could have real emotions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005406|Oh. Then I find you... predictable as well.|Unused to small talk.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005405|I'm not talking about our enemies, I'm talking about us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005404|What, you mean I'm predictable? I should eliminate that, it will only assist my enemies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005403|You can always be relied on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005402|You don't...lie. Or exaggerate. You just, do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005401|Is that a good a thing?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005400|And not just for the sake of survival. It's your friends, your companions who make all of this make sense, they make it worth fighting for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005399|I suppose that depends on the challenges that are to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005398|So it seems for many people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005397|And believing in someone, that makes you wonder, what will you be once all this is over? Will you still remain as close?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005396|You have to choose your friends carefully.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005395|Yes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005394|Yes, but it's not all about the challenges, is it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005393|I can understand that... I have had to fight my entire life. Always thinking about what is just in front of me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005392|You can only survive on Magalan if you are strong enough. If you focus on the things that are dangerous to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005391|No.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005390|I am not sure that I understood your meaning correctly...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005389|When you spoke about friendship and the future?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005388|Yes?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005387|Of course. I understand.. Then let's talk again another time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005386|I am still trying to understand my emotions, they are still confusing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005385|It seems I do understand you now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005384|Then it is good to have that clearly spoken.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005383|Feelings are just emotions, they are a waste of our energy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005382|We are right for each other, for the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005381|Mh... Yeah, we should...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005380|Yes?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005379|Listen, we should talk about it alone. Uninterrupted would be best.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005378|Why? What else is there?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005377|You understand, just listen to your feelings.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005376|Hey. Have you thought what you will do when all of this is over?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005375|About our recent conversation...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005374|I've never met anyone like you before.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005373|Good luck with your struggle, I can no longer be a part of it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005372|I hope you can start to understand your emotions better, or you will only hurt yourself and that...that could change the future of our whole world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005370|I have had enough of your cold logic.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005369|You need to change your attitude, or I'm gone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005368|Are you going to take my perspective into account at any point?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005367|Let's hope he can be trusted.|Unconvinced
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005366|The Hybrid has started work again, but for the good of all. He is now a protector of this world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005365|Then Thorald was right all along. Who'd've known...|Surprised.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005364|I convinced him to change his mind. I think he will work with the people of Magalan now, rather than try to destroy them. He could be a force for good.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005363|What about the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005362|We must take this chance.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005361|It is for us to decide the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005360|Well, it's over now.|Tired, pained after sensing it
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005359|It's good that he's dead, but...do you think that could be our future? A man made into a monster by Elex. All that power turned to destruction?|Reflecting on her own dliemma
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005358|Better than the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005357|You are doing well, I see.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005356|It's strange to say it, but an Alb is the only person I know who can understand me. That's almost stranger than what we've learned about the Elex.|Amused, warm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005355|Yes.|Matter of fact he's still getting used to emotion
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005354|You know that I love you, right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005353|This struggle will determine the fate of all the people on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005352|I hope the differences between the Free Peoples won't mean we lose this war against the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005351|Entering Xacor will be a terrible risk. We will have to prepare ourselves well.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005350|We are on the brink of the final battle against the Albs. All of Magalan is depending on us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005349|People will only follow you if you can understand the world from their perspective, if you truly support their interests.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005348|I will try to assist you in your struggle in any way I can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005347|I can see that you are struggling with your emotions. It must seem more natural to fall back on logic alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005346|People trust you. You must prove worthy of that trust.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005345|I respect you for that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005344|You may have once been an Alb, but you have come to terms with your emotions. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005342|You must learn to embrace emotion. You can use it to make you stronger. Learn that, or...I feel we will have to party ways.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005341|I feel like I am talking to a machine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005340|You worry me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005339|Life is good. I like being here, with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005338|I'm doing all right. Thank you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005337|I am okay.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005336|Just leave me be. Okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005335|I'm fine.|Cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005334|How are you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005333|I think I've still got things to work out when it comes to the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005332|I think I made her angry.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005331|All Elex to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005330|The past is irrelevant.  Only the future counts.|Concurring with his brother, ending his questions
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005329|Tarek said the Hybrid saw the Fall. That Magalan ignored his warning about the Comet.|The set answer
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005328|I heard Tarek and Parsek discussing the time before the Hybrid, the moment they found him. I think that is what I was sensing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005327|What did you see when you had your audience with the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005326|There was something else though, Jax. A sense of the past, but I couldn't see it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005325|And so the Hybrid serves the Albs and the Albs will see his Directive is carried out. All Elex to the Hybrid.|Falling back to the official response
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005324|I always knew his mind stretched across Magalan, but what I saw...The Hybrid truly sees all.|Awestruck Trying to rationalise what he experienced
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005323|He summoned me. I obeyed. He opened his mind to me and I saw...the universe. Skies stretching to infinity.|Trying to rationalise what he experienced
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005322|You had an audience with the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005321|Such stories are irrelevant.|Unemotional
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005320|All Elex to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005319|The Hybrid has given us purpose. Before him we sought evolution, only with him can we find it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005318|I don't know. I don't remember anything from then. I know I saw him, that we spoke. That since then I have known his will, understood his purpose clearer than I did before.|Trying to remember
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005317|The Hybrid shows us only what we need to see.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005316|Know my thoughts and serve the Directive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005315|Hhhh.... Arrgh...|Pained as the chip bonds Kallax with the Hybrid.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005314|And so it shall be... Open your mind to me, Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005313|The Hybrid's will is above all. I will serve the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005312|Are you ready to play that part, Kallax? Will you join those chosen to evolve?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005311|You will all have a part to play in the events that are to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005310|I have watched you and your brother and the honor you have brought to your father.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005309|You are efficient. You obey your orders. Those are the marks of a true Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005308|Kallax. You have proven yourself loyal to the Directive. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005307|You summoned me, master?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005306|It is not our place to question his ways. It is our duty to serve his will. You and your sons.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005305|Are you questioning the Hybrid? Whatever has happened at the Converter must be his will.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005304|You don't speak to the Hybrid unless you are summoned.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005303|The Hybrid would have seen that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005302|This is more than a malfunction. I think the Berserkers have attacked the Converter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005301|A technical malfunction should have been repaired by now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005300|Yes. The Converter there is inactive. It went offline hours ago.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005299|Wardek. I have received reports of problems with the production of Elex in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005298|We know our place, Parsek. We serve the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005297|We cannot implement the will of the Hybrid if he doesn't tell us what it is. Or, if we lose any more Converters.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005296|Then get yourself summoned. We need to know what's going on and why he has withdrawn.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005295|Then speak to the Hybrid, Parsek. I'm telling you what I know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005294|I suspect it has been overrun.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005293|Duty and honor stand above all. Without them, we are nothing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005292|We will bring you only honor, father. The Directive stands above all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005291|So speaks a true Alb. I am proud of you both. Your strength, your commitment to the cause they are known throughout Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005290|We will remain vigilant to the enemy within as well as without.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005289|We should send word to all units, any signs of emotion must be reported immediately.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005288|Separatists? You mean traitors. Do you think someone could be deliberately tampering with the Elex rations?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005287|Whatever the cause, this isn't isolated. Several groups of Separatists have broken from our ranks recently.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005286|I want to know if they had help in escaping.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005285|They grew weak. Once their Elex rations were restored, they should have seen the truth of that. Instead, they killed their own kind and ran.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005284|Their unit was cut off from their Elex rations. They developed emotions.|Straight explanation
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005283|Why did they turn against the Directive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005282|Some of them have even taken to wearing the clothing of the Free People.|Viewing bodies of Alb separatists, disdain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005281|Yes, Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005280|My orders are to leave immediately. Complete final preparations for takeoff.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005279|It won't affect the handling. And someone would have to be a very good shot to hit it. Are you sure there's not time for a repair?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005278|Will that affect the mission?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005277|We had a problem with one of the thruster ports, it seems to have jammed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005276|Good, I will need to leave immediately.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005275|It was a last minute order, but we have it done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005274|Yes, Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005273|Is the raider prepared for take off?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005272|Yes, First Elexetor. All Elex to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005271|You will begin the redeployment immediately and without further question.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005270|He sees our future and his cause is ours. We must deliver his vision. Efficiently. And no one can stand in its way, no matter their rank.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005269|The Hybrid sees things that we do not. He saw the fall, the world ignored him and all was fire. The Albs will not repeat that mistake. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005268|Have you ever asked yourself what will happen to us once we've harvested all the Elex from the Free People? Where will he turn then?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005267|It is for the greater purpose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005266|So, he says So, he has always said. And yet he orders, he consumes and we die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005265|The Hybrid sees our future. Through him, we will evolve.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005264|Our first Directive was to reach the next stage of evolution. How are we to achieve that if all our Elex goes to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005263|The Albs existed before the Hybrid. We gathered Elex for ourselves without his guidance.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005262|It is not for us to question the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005261|I serve the Hybrid. All Elex to the Hybrid. But, with the Converter in Edan silent, how are we to achieve that?|Frustrated
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005260|It is not for the Hybrid to explain himself. His will is the Directive, the Directive must be followed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005259|Ignadon? Did the Hybrid explain why we are to move troops from an area where we are short of forces to face an enemy incapable of threatening us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005258|So the Hybrid orders, so his will must be done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005257|Yes, we need to order a new troop deployment. You are to move forces out of Edan to the border of Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005256|First Elexetor Tarek, you summoned me? |Businesslike
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005255|I will not dishonor you. I will ensure this Alb's failure does not reflect on us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005254|Honor the Hybrid. Serve the Hybrid.|Falling back to the official response
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005253|It can only be a matter of time before he summons you to him. You bring our father honor. I am honored to be your brother. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005252|I am no Elexetor. The Hybrid has yet to call me for that honor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005251|Spoken like a true Elexetor, Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005250|Failure cannot be tolerated, get this right before their failure becomes yours.|Cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005249|Are you saying I was wrong to assign him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005248|You were right to kill him. The Directive only allows one outcome for failure.|Straight, unemotional
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005247|He will be hard to replace. There aren't many Albs with his skills|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005246|You will need to assign someone to complete his mission.|Cold, straight after executing an Alb
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005245|I serve the Hybrid. His will is above all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005244|They would do anything to have the favor you have won. You honor our people, but there are those who think of themselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005243|Elex does not allow for emotion, but you should be careful, Commander Jax. There are those who envy your rise in power.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005242|The Elexetors select you for roles they could only give you if the Hybrid had agreed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005241|I carry out the will of the Hybrid. I am what the Hybrid makes of me.|Unmoved
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005240|The Hybrid must recognize that even the Elexetors speak of you as an equal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005239|Nevertheless, the victory is yours.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005238|It was a logical move. And we must remain vigilant. They won't fall for that again.|Unmoved
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005237|You've shattered their attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005236|Congratulations. Waiting for the enemy to commit their troops before you revealed the Fighting Colossi. It left the enemy nowhere to go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005235|His is the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005234|The Hybrid sees all. The Hybrid will be served.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005233|I think the time is drawing near, Kallax. I think the Hybrid will soon take us to the next level of evolution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005232|Emotion makes animals of men. Don't try to understand them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005231|Why do they do it, Jax? Can't they see these attacks are hopeless?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005230|I will see that is done. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005229|Save your troops for the Converters. We must secure the Elex supply.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005228|You did well, Jax. The Clerics' attack has been pushed back. We are preparing our counterattack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005227|The Hybrid's will shall be served.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005226|You don't want to do this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005225|The Duke is irrelevant. All must bow to the Hybrid, or die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005224|We're just here to look for this guy. We've seen what we need to, so we can go back to the Duke. No trouble, yeah?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005223|Um... Hey, man. You can have the Elex! We'll get out of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005222|Is that him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005221|Shit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005220|All Elex to the Hybrid.|The Alb salute
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005219|You can't run from those guys, they want you dead, you're dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005218|Then let's get the fuck out of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005217|Could be, I heard there's an Alb Commander moved into this area.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005216|Fuck. You think they're still around?|Scared
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005215|No, look at the blast marks. This was Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005214|Shit. What happened here? You think Baxter did this?|Looking at the corpse
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005213|These people called themselves - The Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005212|One Alb, selected to change the fate of Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005211|Now, as Alb forces prepare their final assault, Jax, a renowned Alb Commander, is sent on solo mission.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005210|Advancing from the frozen wastes of Xacor and their fortress Ice Palace, the Albs threaten the future of all the factions on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005209|Seemingly unstoppable, the Albs have waged war on all who stand between them and their need to obtain  Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005208|But, there were some who could control their addiction. To them, at the cost of their emotions, Elex offered strength, focus and stamina.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005207|Seduced by Elex's power, some began to consume it. Addicted, overwhelmed, most degenerated into vicious, mindless mutants.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005206|For the Clerics, it drove new technological innovation. For the Outlaws, drugs to free their minds. To Berserkers it gave the power of magic. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005205|Elex. An element unknown to Magalan, it could fuel technology, change the evolution of life, open new abilities to those with the will to control it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005204|But, it wasn't only the struggle for scarce Old World resources that drove them. For the Comet had brought something new.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005203|Fighting amongst the ruins of the Old World, new factions arose. The Berserkers, the Clerics, the Outlaws, each with their own vision of the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005202|And as Magalan fell into darkness, the survivors faced a world that was unrecognizable.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005201|Until the Comet hit. Earthquakes shattered its cities. Firestorms swept the planet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005200|Magalan. Home to a civilization of millions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005199|And you think you can convince people of that?|Doubtful
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005198|We must trust him. He is the only one who can guide us through the dangers to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005197|So, what, you're saying we can trust that thing now?|Uncertain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005196|If we are to survive then I have to convince all of Magalan, or there will be no future for any of us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005195|But, it will take some time before he truly accepts his new role as protector of Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005194|Yes, I changed the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005193|Yes. I defeated the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005192|You did?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005191|I don't know why, but from the first moment I saw you I knew you could do it|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005190|Best compliment you're going to get from me, asshole.|Positive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005189|That's good to know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005188|People can say what they want, but... I think you're okay.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005187|You haven't just decided the war, you've looked out for the little people too.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005186|But, you know, you turned out to be okay.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005185|Yeah, Okay, well to be completely honest, when I saw you for the first time, I thought: 'Who the fuck is this asshole?'|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005184|Yes. The war against the Hybrid has been won.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005183|So, you did it. You did do it, right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005182|Things won't take care of themselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005181|What are you doing here? You need to get your ass into Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005180|Meaning....what? That he wants to rule us? Or, he's going to help everyone including the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005179|The Hybrid will soon take the fate of every living being on Magalan into his hands.|Answering 30/2
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005178|And I've got to say, I knew you were the one to make sense of all this. I saw it, I saw it before all others.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005177|The Albs are still patrolling, I saw them only a few hours ago.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005176|You want me to believe that the Albs will agree to get friendly and help us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005175|The Hybrid will work with the Free People, he will help us change the future.|Answering 30/2
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005174|The Hybrid lives, but the balance of power has shifted.|Answering 30/2
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005173|So, know that we stand with you in the storm to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005172|Origin was founded to provide you with a base.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005171|Well, that's...not terrifying at all. But, I suppose we don't have any choice but to roll with it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005170|You chose me to lead the people here in Origin. Now, you must follow my decision.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005169|Yes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005168|And you believe him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005167|The Hybrid has evolved beyond any of us. His abilities have foreseen a danger that threatens us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005166|What storm? Who are we fighting now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005165|You should look to the defenses of this place. They will be needed in the storm to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005164|Yes. And you should cease your resistance to their plans. Only the Hybrid and his chosen can survive what is to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005163|Really? Then the Albs have lost their leader?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005162|The Hybrid is dead.|Answering 30/2
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005161|Can you tell us what is going on?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005160|The reports from Xacor are pretty confused.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005159|Yeah. If I needed a hurry up, that was it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005158|Finish your work. We have a lot to do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005157|Yes, for now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005156|So, we might be safe?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005155|He won't tell the others about us until he has been successful in his mission. Otherwise he'd have to admit his failure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005154|Those combat mechs were under the command of just one Elexetor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005153|No.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005152|I thought we were going to lose the camp then. Do you think they will return in force and overrun us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005151|Damn, those Albs caught us off guard.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005150|Not exactly. Many of them don't yet know what is coming.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005149|So, is the struggle against the Albs is over?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005148|Well, if you say it does, but it's a hard thing to accept.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005147|Those who work with the Hybrid, do not need to fear the Hybrid. Our future depends on him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005146|What about the Converters?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005145|The Hybrid is devoting himself to the preparation of the world for what is to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005144|He is beginning to work for peace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005143|He has ingested Mana and it is altering the way he thinks.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005142|The Hybrid is changing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005141|I hope you stay safe out there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005140|Good. Then let us make sure we all survive until that peace comes to us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005139|It is just a matter of time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005138|I hope that we will be able to see peace soon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005137|Well, I hope that is good news. One less threat would help us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005136|That will change now that the Hybrid is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005135|It is not only in Xacor that things are changing. Abessa is now a battleground in this war..|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005134|Because, most Alb plans seem to be about destroying everything on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005133|And, do these incredible plans have space for me and the Duke making profit?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005132|Yeah? Is that so? |Suspicious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005131|The Hybrid has plans, he's going to change this world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005130|I'm thinking it would be safer if you didn't leave this place alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005129|I'm thinking, I don't have to live with anything.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005128|You're going to have to live with it.|Assured
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005127|Can you trust it? I mean that thing was crazy enough without cramming it with that stuff.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005126|Mana? You're feeding it the Berserkers' magic?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005125|Even you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005124|The Hybrid was contaminated with Mana. He is working for all of us now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005123|And, if a man who killed the Hybrid didn't start to get other ideas about who on Magalan they would overthrow.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005122|If there's any truth to it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005121|Yes, it is. And you should believe it too.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005120|If that's what you believe...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005119|Do you think it's possible to survive in Tavar without doing that? And, what I know is anything coming from the Hybrid's mouth can't be trusted.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005118|The Comet hitting Magalan wasn't an accident. We need to be prepared for what comes next.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005117|What?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005116|You want to stick your head in the desert sand, it won't stop what's coming.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005115|And, nervous tends to end up with people shooting each other, so does us all favor and keep your mouth shut about that stuff.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005114|You keep spouting that stuff about its plans you're going to make the people here nervous.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005113|I'd advise you to remember the Duke's official line - 'Fuck the Hybrid'.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005111|Now, there is a chance to earn profit. With that power gone, there won't be much to stop the Outlaws.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005110|And, the Hybrid is dead?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005109|Is it true?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005108|It's a stubborn rumor. Those sort of things often turn out to be true.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005107|There is a rumor going around that you were with the Hybrid in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005106|What do you want?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005105|Hey, you! We have to talk.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005104|The Berserkers, all of the Free People will fight until the last of your kind has been exterminated.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005103|This fight is not over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005102|You can keep your words.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005101|And this from a Berserker? You're serving a machine!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005100|You think you enslave all of Magalan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005099|The Berserkers are now subject to the word and authority of the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005098|The time of resisting and transforming Elex is over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005097|May your name be honored everywhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005096|The fact that you are one of us fills me with pride.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005095|The Berserkers are in your debt. Your name will be spoken as we return Magalan to the world it was.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005094|Now, we can live in freedom, thanks to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005093|So it's true. That's more than we could have hoped for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005092|He is now prepared to negotiate with the Free People. You can find a way to work together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005091|The Mana is changing the Hybrid. He is developing feelings.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005090|The Pilgrim's plan to use Mana worked.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005089|The Hybrid lives, he spoke to me and was prepared to negotiate.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005088|Thorald entrusted me with the day-to-day running of Goliet so that he could focus on the Hybrid and now...it has paid. We are free from his threat.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005087|This is a day I never thought I would see.|Pleased, amazed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005086|The Hybrid is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005085|And, what of the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005084|That is good news for all of Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005083|Yes. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005082|I've heard that the Ice Palace has been attacked. And that you were behind that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005081|If that is the choice then may death find me before that day comes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005080|Then you shall die. All shall bow to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005079|Join us? The Hybrid will want nothing short of worship. We worship only Calaan, not this thing that would become a god..|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005078|And to give you this last chance to join us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005077|I stand before you as his messenger.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005076|What? How do you know that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005075|No, the Hybrid isn't dead. He has completed his preparations and will now begin to change Magalan to live in his image.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005074|And, the Berserkers came up with this plan? That is quite incredible.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005073|It has made him more aware, he now has a conscience and is capable of empathy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005072|Mana? The Elex the Berserkers process with their plants? And, that has altered the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005071|He has ingested Mana, exposure to it has changed who he is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005070|Serve the Free People? I find that hard to believe.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005069|The Hybrid isn't dead, but he will serve the Free People from now on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005068|I hope that this means an end to all conflicts and not merely a change of enemy to one of the other factions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005067|Calaan has shown the way to us all. For it is a Clerics who has proved to be the savior of Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005066|The world will know your name.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005065|May Calaan protect you. May your name be honored through the ages.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005064|That is truly good news.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005063|Then praise be to Calaan for sending you to us. The war must finally be over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005062|It is true. I killed him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005061|If the news is true then the Hybrid is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005060|You must welcome that news.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005059|There has been news from the Ice Palace, they say that the Hybrid is no longer a threat.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005058|Not everyone will understand the changes that are happening here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005057|All Elex to the Hybrid.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005052|So...the conflict continues?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005051|You will need to eliminate those who stand against us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005050|You should stay here in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005049|Tell me how I can help you.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005047|You confronted him? Does that mean the war is over?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005046|You didn't know at the time, but your attack was what allowed me to reach the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005045|It was the chip in your head. When you tried to execute me, you destroyed the chip and released me from his control.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005044|The Hybrid did something to me, to prevent me from reaching him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005043|The closer I got to the Hybrid, the worse my headaches became.|Pained
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005042|Are you all right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005041|I will discover the Hybrid's true intentions. For us and for Magalan. Try not to get yourself killed in the meantime.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005040|No, I....I....|In pain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005039|He knows you could be a danger to him. Stay here. I will go on alone. I will get the answers we seek.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005038|I... I can't reach him. I can't go further. Why would he block me?|In pain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005037|The Hybrid is using the chip to stop you.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005035|The Hybrid is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005034|One day I will make you realize what you have given up. One day you will beg for forgiveness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005033|You must remember the power you had when you were an Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005032|But, know this Jax, there will come a day when we see each other again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005031|I will go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005030|You still don't realize the strength I have gained since I left Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005029|Since when was mercy one of your qualities?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005028|I will let you live, but only if you disappear and never return.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005027|That's my choice?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005026|Accept that, if you want to live.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005024|Or the death of my enemy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005023|It is only my death that would be of consequence.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005021|If you don't you will die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005020|You will learn to fear the mutant force that serves me.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005016|But, you must know that your goals are not compatible with mine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005015|I will not fight you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005014|But, your reign in Tarek's place will not be long.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00005000|There is no obstacle that cannot be overcome.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004991|Then we must begin our planning and start the work of rebuilding Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004990|Our people will have to change. We must work with all the people on Magalan from now on, this is our only chance in the times to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004989|All Elex to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004988|I will assist you in the trials that are to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004987|But, what you have accomplished ...you have, you will determine the fate of our world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004986|Anyone else in your position would have died, or given up.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004985|When I heard about you had been executed, I thought that was the end of you. Even when I started to hear news of your survival, I doubted your return.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004984|I admit, I underestimated your abilities.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004983|A world that we create and control ourselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004982|But, all those who have survived will be part of the new world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004981|We will have to care for our own people first. The Albs must now decide their future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004980|Yes. But, the war has caused great damage.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004979|Correct. It is for us to decide our future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004978|But if... if what you are saying is true. Then our future is not predetermined as the Hybrid said.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004977|Things must change here in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004976|It has changed him, for the sake of all Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004975|Mana? Didn't that poison him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004974|No. the Hybrid has consumed some Berserker Mana, he is changing.|Undercutting Tarek.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004973|Yes. And now the Hybrid will bring all of us to the next step of evolution.|Revelling in the moment.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004972|You must be prepared for changes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004971|Our future is at hand, soon we will claim the rewards we have been promised.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004970|It is done. The Machine has commenced its work.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004968|The Alb defenses are finished. Ulbricht and Konrad are dead. Ah, what a beautiful day.|Pleased
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004967|Then my work has paid off. I was right.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004966|The Albs, however...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004965|He will stand by the Free People of Magalan now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004964|Yes. The Hybrid has already started to develop emotions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004963|Mana is already changing him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004962|I cannot allow that betrayal to go unpunished.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004961|My hope, my faith have caused me to fail a second time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004960|I trusted a tool of the Machine to set things right.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004959|How could I have been so foolish to believe that it could have been different.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004958|What do you mean? You reconnected with him?|Realising
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004957|Your role will be different than you imagined.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004956|It is done. Exactly as you wanted. The Hybrid will begin a new age.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004955|Look after yourself, we shall meet again, friend.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004954|We will need your strength if we are to defend our planet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004953|We must begin our preparations.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004951|You will inspire us in the challenges to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004950|I hope to be able to stand at your side when the time comes..|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004949|You have shown us that we can overcome challenges if we work together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004948|Then time will be our enemy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004947|He didn't say, but at most we have only a few years.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004946|How much time do we have before they arrive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004945|What else did he tell you of this threat?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004944|So, that is what motivated him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004943|They were responsible for the Comet. Now they are coming to conquer us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004942|The Hybrid was gathering Elex to prepare Magalan for the arrival of another threat to our world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004941|I fear that it will not.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004940|All that counts is that we can now believe in our future. We can make it what we want.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004939|As long as they do that, they will not stop fighting us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004938|Many of them will continue to bring Elex north in the hope of reaching the next stage of evolution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004937|Well... The Albs won't be quick to accept that their time is over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004936|We can begin to look to a future free from the Albs, free from Converters, free to choose our own destiny.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004935|I had hoped we could tame that monster, but...his death will set us free nonetheless.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004934|The Hybrid is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004933|Is it over? Were you able to inject the Mana into the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004932|You must take on the next task.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004931|It is the only way he can be stopped.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004930|You must inject Mana into the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004929|The fate of Magalan is on your shoulders.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004928|Go, change the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004927|That's it. The Albs defenses have been destroyed. But, our work is far from complete.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004926|The Hybrid intends to terraform the whole world and there is nothing you can do to stop it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004925|But, so you understand. You will lose Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004924|The Albs too.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004923|And the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004922|It isn't just Xacor, this world must change..|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004921|He can do what he wants in Xacor. As long as the Hybrid stays on his side of the ice border, I don't care.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004920|A great deal, but I doubt you could understand it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004919|The quicker you say goodbye to this world, the better for all of us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004916|Either way, you're too much of a threat to be left standing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004915|What you're saying is true and those tree hugging assholes will come for us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004914|Hah, either you're full of shit, or worse yet...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004913|I guess you could say that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004912|You managed to pump the Hybrid full of that Berserker shit?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004911|He ingested Mana. It has changed him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004910|So, what did the Hybrid say?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004908|Stay in Xacor and all will be well. Challenge me and you will regret it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004907|Tell the Hybrid he should think again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004906|Ha... Then the Albs are fucked too?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004905|Believe what you want. But, the Hybrid won't cause any more trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004904|Is that what they said?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004903|Yeah, but no one believes it. But, say did you kill it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004902|Yeah, they were even saying you killed it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004900|Is that what you heard?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004899|I heard you were with that infernal machine, the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004898|The destruction of the Alb defenses was nothing to do with you that's for sure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004897|Arrgh... It's as cold as death here. I don't understand how the Albs have lasted so long in this place.|Cold pain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004896|No, it is just a gift that the world has given to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004895|Well, that was a good show, but I had better go before I freeze to death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004893|Maybe the cold for so long is why the Alb defenses gave way. Maybe it was too cold even for that bunch of bastards.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004892|Man, you rarely get to see a show as good as this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004891|The self-righteous Judicator Ulbricht and his followers are here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004890|The Cleric Konrad is still alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004889|If that's so then why are you here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004888|Why should I help you and the damn Clerics? If you think that's happening, you've lost your mind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004887|You had better get out of here. The longer you stay, the more likely you are to lose the battle.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004885|To watch the Albs put you lot down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004883|Didn't you hear the attack order?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004882|You were always an Alb and you always will be.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004881|I had feared something like this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004880|But, if this is the choice we face, then we Clerics made that decision a long time ago.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004879|So, you return with more threats and fear, more...tyranny. He has tried to conquer us and now we are supposed to just surrender to him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004878|And what if we refuse?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004877|It is regrettable that people mean so little to you that you would risk their lives out of fear of change.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004876|That would not be wise.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004875|That is your only choice. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004874|The time of the Free People is over. You will submit to the Hybrid now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004873|From today on, he will strive for balance and justice for all lifeforms on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004872|That is over with. He is something else now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004871|It is. The Hybrid was always the pinnacle of evolution for them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004870|None of us will be safe as long as that infernal machine is still alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004869|I was hoping that his rule of terror over the Albs was finally over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004868|I contaminated the Hybrid with transmuted Elex. His nature is changing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004867|Magalan is about to change fundamentally.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004866|I hope you have found enlightenment from amongst this chaos.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004865|May Calaan watch over you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004864|But, in the end, hope and freedom has come from an unexpected to place - you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004863|I admit, I did have my doubts with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004862|Our world has much to thank you for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004861|We can only hope that they come to their senses and find a more peaceful path.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004860|The Hybrid was not the only threat, the Albs remain, armed and a danger to us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004859|Hey, man. Don't fool around, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004858|You want me to hurt you and then you give me the contract?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004857|You know, me giving you this is useless. The other contracts are already out there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004856|Give it to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004855|The contract outlines how the kill is supposed to play out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004854|But, I can't go suggesting you murder someone here in the Fort... Not officially. That could cause me business problems. What you do in your own time is up to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004853|What would happen if I took care of Ray right now? Would I get the reward?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004852|That's me. Mr. Transaction.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004851|So, you're not behind this hit, you're just a middleman?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004850|The Hybrid is dead. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004849|Then tell me, what news do you have?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004848|Yes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004847|It's said you met the Hybrid. Is that true?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004846|You will find your path. Until then you will be in my prayers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004845|I am not sure my faith is strong enough for that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004844|Well, remember: Only those with strong faith will bring about real change.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004843|I was worried you would feel that way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004842|My path continues to lead to the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004841|We can't continue to wear down our forces.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004840|What about you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004839|We will have to place all of our focus on Ignadon and Hort to protect them from our enemies...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004838|But, the losses on our side have been grievous.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004835|The Albs lost the majority of their fighting strength.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004834|We can't hesitate now. This is the only way we will be victorious.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004833|It will begin when Thorald gives the order.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004832|Yes, but each step takes us closer to where we need to be.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004831|There is more than one battle left in this war.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004830|The feud between Clerics and Albs, will soon be over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004829|You should go and speak to Thorald then we can finally get started.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004828|You almost missed all the fun here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004827|Our victory is near at hand. Go and take care of them. Kill the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004826|We have to take care of their defenses. And we must ensure that we eliminate them all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004825|Let's take care of these bastards. Don't leave anyone alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004824|We can't leave a single enemy behind us, or they will stab us in the back.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004823|Well then... attack!|Called out/projected
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004822|Every man ready?!|Called out/projected
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004821|So be it. This is the moment of truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004820|If you have anything to take care of before the attack, you must do it now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004819|We stand ready for the order to attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004818|They have realized that by now. As we have all realized that this all depends on you now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004817|It is the only way we stand a chance against the Alb defenses.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004816|And so you are going to work with Nasty, will you fight alongside the Clerics?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004815|If you are ready then we can leave immediately.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004814|I am ready. Let us commence the attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004813|Good work, Commander. The Alb people have you to thank for this new future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004812|Which is why I will try to make sure that peace and order reign for our people, as quickly as I can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004811|But, many of us still see you as a threat and will continue to fight you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004810|You were the strongest of us, Jax. You were the turning point in this war.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004809|Good, then we Albs finally have the chance to right the wrongs that have been done to us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004808|Yes. He is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004805|The Hybrid's path must be the one we follow. All must comply with his will.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004804|We cannot afford for our people to fall under his control again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004803|We will need to keep a close eye on him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004802|If not, then the Hybrid will have to die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004801|Do you think this can work?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004800|The path of mercy, probably the most complicated of all conceivable outcomes to this war.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004799|And you are seeking to work with the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004798|I contaminated his Elex source with Mana.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004797|We will no longer follow him, he will work for us from now on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004796|But, the Hybrid's presence can still be felt. What happened?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004795|I assume the Hybrid is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004794|You truly are remarkable.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004793|Any other Alb would have succumbed to his power.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004792|Yes. It was a hard fight, but I was victorious.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004791|You saw the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004790|Yes... We will have to adapt if we want to survive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004789|Confidence? A very emotional quality for an Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004788|Good luck to you, we all need you to succeed. I am confident you will succeed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004787|You have broken free from his control, perhaps you can stand against him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004786|None of our people have been able to withstand the Hybrid's control, he inflicts pain on all those who attempt to get close to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004785|I could use your help in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004784|You have to stop him before it's too late.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004783|The Hybrid has lost the majority of his army. But, he still lives, and he has Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004782|There were many victims in this war. We have to start rebuilding now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004781|You should have been there during the battle.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004780|I didn't expect you to do that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004779|You fought to the very end.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004778|It will take many years to heal the wounds that the Hybrid dealt to our people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004777|The defensive line has been destroyed. Elexetor Tarek has lost the battle.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004776|When Thorald gives the order to attack, we will finally see who will survive this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004775|Indeed, but whatever our fortune, we're not in the Ice Palace yet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004774|That is our job, for you have another to take care of.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004773|He underestimated us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004772|The Ice Palace is now vulnerable.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004771|Elexetor Tarek has sent most of his troops into battle.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004769|Damn it. What is wrong with you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004768|There you are. We are ready.|Impatient
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004767|I know that you have things still to finish. Now is the time for you to do that. Complete your business in the world before it changes forever.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004766|Once you are done, we will begin building the future..|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004765|Tell me and it will be done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004764|It will take the machine time to process the Elex we have. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004763|I am preparing for the things that must follow.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004762|What must be done to prepare for the arrival of those who follow the comet?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004761|Then you will have more power than you can imagine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004760|It is your task to prepare the people of Magalan for their arrival.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004759|Those who would be the new lords of this world will arrive soon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004758|So be it. All must hear the word of the Hybrid. All Elex will be ours.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004757|Soon you will be ready to take the next step in evolution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004756|You will shape our future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004755|That is your destiny.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004754|And all Magalan shall bow to Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004753|But, you shall control all those who serve me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004752|I will lead your visions, that is my destiny.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004751|The future is yours, Jax. It is for you to lead us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004750|You will receive all the Elex you need to ensure that Magalan belongs to the Albs, that we will be the chosen.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004749|Your guidance will take us there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004748|You are truly worthy of leading these forces. You will lead the chosen into the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004747|They will accept their destiny, or they will die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004746|I will take this truth to the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004745|Very well.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004744|You will continue to communicate with these beings by informing me of all that must be done. The Albs will reach the next stage of evolution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004743|Begin your preparations.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004742|Then I will put Xacor's defense in your hands. If you agree I will begin the preparations to activate the machine and begin to change our world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004741|I have no interest in becoming a mutant. You will stay there to serve the Albs, while I ensure the Free People do not interfere with our plans.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004740|You should take my place in the machine and become the new Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004739|I have done my best to prepare for the arrival of those who are yet to come. Now it is your right to take my place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004737|Then you must use your strength.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004736|The Free People fight amongst themselves. Their leaders believe more in superstition than in logic. They cannot fight against the beings you describe.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004735|For the Free People do not have the strength to fight these beings. You must see their weakness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004734|It is too late. People can never trust me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004733|Then I will go to them. I will convince them your abilities are key to the future for all the people of Magalan. I will tell them your knowledge is the only way to stop this enemy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004732|I can't...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004731|You can become a force for good.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004730|Your plan was to save only your self. But, you have changed, you are realizing that the world must be saved.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004729|Remember when you were human. Before the Comet hit, before the Elex changed you. Your name was Dr. Adam Charles Dawkins. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004728|Then you have no choice. You must destroy me. This suffering cannot continue.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004727|You can see it all now? That destruction was all your work.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004726|So much suffering. An ocean of blood gushes over the land. Lives, potential, drown in it.|Mana gives the Hybrid emotions for the first time and he begins to break down.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004725|We will see to that!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004724|You know nothing of the future. I see all and I tell you...I tell you...that you cannot fight them.|Still resisting
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004723|We will control our own future. Once the Mana takes effect, you will see this.|Calm explanation
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004722|Your prediction about me was wrong. You cannot predict what the future holds.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004721|The Free People are not strong enough to survive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004720|You will work with the Free People. Your insight will help us to defeat these invaders.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004719|You cannot be allowed to complete your plan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004718|You have defeated me, but you are not strong enough to fight the beings coming to rule our world. If I die then so does Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004717|So, you will submit, or will you die?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004716|Despite all of my preparation and all the Elex, you have shown yourself stronger than all of that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004715|Of all the futures I had seen, this was not amongst them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004714|He will return one day, of that I'm sure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004713|Well, I have no intel on his whereabouts, he has disappeared.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004712|He betrayed me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004711|Why from you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004709|He will not come back here. He is on the run from Xacor and from me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004708|Well then, I don't know when he will return.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004707|I thought he would join you in your fight against the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004706|No, he didn't.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004705|He left shortly after the last time you were here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004704|Where is Wardek? Where is my father?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004703|If he's going to Ignadon he must have gone north by the old greenhouse dome.|Straight
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004702|I'd better get there soon if I'm going to stop him.|Straight
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004701|As a full Elexetor, Kallax was the one who had access. He was the one who always spoke directly to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004700|There must be more to this, it just doesn't add up.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004699|Your strength is admirable, but you are so misguided in your aims, that is your weakness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004698|I have broken free, you are still the Hybrid's servant.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004697|Zardom only ever had one goal: your position. The rank of First Elexetor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004696|You have only proved that I was right to doubt you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004695|And, he was right to hide your heritage. I would have doubted your abilities.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004694|Then Wardek has been flawed for longer than I thought.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004693|But, we are not his children. We weren't even born in Xacor. Wardek took us from the Berserkers as children. And he fought to keep that secret from you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004692|And Wardek dreamed of creating a dynasty, a legacy for himself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004691|There is more to it than that, they worked together to plan this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004690|Wardek was brought down by your frailties. Zardom grew too emotional. He believed in himself before the Directive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004689|Wardek and Zardom betrayed us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004688|My jetpack, finally some luck. The guy that took my armor must have dropped it.|The jetpack lies on the floor after he has taken the lift down from the mountain. He's in an underground hallway. Through one door and to the right, and he's out and meets Duras.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004687|Edan. The Land of the Berserkers. If they recognize me...they could finish Kallax's job for him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004686|Rotting technology from the Old World, that's all that's here. I'd better move on.|to himself, inside the station, looking at some old machines as he travels through the building
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004685|Old World ruins. Maybe I can find something useful in there.|Observing the ruins - he's close to them
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004683|My skin...I look like one of the Free People. There mustn't be a scrap of Elex left in my body...|Concerned - to himself
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004682|No, no, if Kallax had seen I was still alive, he would have finished the job. It was someone else...|Ideas racing, figuring this out, urgent. Shaken
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004681|This is Edan, enemy territory. If Kallax returns, or if the Berserkers find me I'll be dead for sure.|Concerned, thinking it through.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004680|I must have been here for days, the Elex is... gone from my system. I feel..weak. Think, think, Jax. My weapons, my armor, did Kallax take them?|Disorientated, realising his things were stolen and then remembering Kallax.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004679|Don't forget Ragnar still wants an answer to Askor's murder. We should tell him something.|Reminding the player, but hoping to bury this subject
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004678|Finding them could be dangerous. But, Ragnar wants the job doing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004677|That makes them jumpy, so I'd be careful around them. They're suspicious of everyone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004676|You don't 'join' the Albs. You're born one, or they choose you. That means most people are taken, rejected and killed horrifically. The survivors are turned into mindless addicts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004675|They might once have been Free People like you and me, but Elex has turned them all into emotionless killing machines. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004674|Go to Xacor if you want, but all that will await you is misery and death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004673|And that survival comes at the cost of anyone around them. Even their own kind.|Trying to stay neutral.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004672|Hah, they might call themselves the kings of the desert, but they're just hanging on to survival like the rest of us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004671|I don't believe in gods and I don't think boxes of cables hold all the answers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004670|The Clerics follow the god Calaan who tells them technology will save us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004669|We could see if the Clerics have left any in the ruins. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004668|Maybe I should join the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004667|Maybe I should join the Outlaws?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004666|Why did you choose to join the Berserkers and not the Clerics?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004665|With luck, neither of them will return and I will be free from the past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004664|Jax will be more vulnerable once he is outside the Ice Palace. If the Hybrid is to be stopped then it is time to act.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004663|Whether this is the warrior gene, or the fighting spirit of the Berserkers I do not know. But, if this becomes widely known I will have no way back. My fate will be sealed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004662|He sent my own brother Kallax to kill me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004661|And all to save his own position at the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004660|The man who claims to be my father wanted me dead, and instead he was forced from the Ice Palace himself. Now we will see which of us death finds first.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004659|So, Wardek, worked with Zardom to sabotage my mission.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004658|Jax's defection will be my death, one way or another. The Exile and the Separatists are now my only chance.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004657|My plan failed. Jax cannot be found.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004656|I will have to leave the Ice Palace and find him before Tarek learns of his treason.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004655|But, all the reports suggest Jax is now fighting alongside the Free People. He has acted against the Directive, against Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004654|I will have to bring them together, so that Kallax can finish his task.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004653|Kallax must have failed his mission to execute his brother. But, he remains the best option I have to eliminate Jax before he can return to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004652|Tarek must not have heard this news, or he would have acted against me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004651|Jax is alive. I have heard many reports that confirm this. It is more than just rumor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004650|The Hybrid's control of them is complete and they will soon take my place. But, what if their past is discovered? No impure can join the chosen. Their impurity may lead to my execution if it is discovered.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004649|If it is their Berserker heritage, that isn't' helping in their struggle to keep their will. It is clear to me that I have lost both of them to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004648|Tarek is beginning to grow suspicious, he will use this to destroy me. Now only the death of my sons can save me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004647|Despite the expectations of some, my sons have grown to become exceptionally strong.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004646|I have asked Zardom to come to the meeting point. He will ensure that things are taken care of from there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004645|Everything will have to move quickly now if I am not to miss this chance to stop him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004644|I just learned that Jax is to be sent in search of Thorald the Pilgrim.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004643|You are a traitor to your kind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004642|The Albs and all of Xacor are doomed if we continue in this way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004641|Death will prove you wrong.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004640|The Albs will evolve, that is Magalan's future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004639|The strong will prevail.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004638|I no longer follow the Directive. I am no slave to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004637|Kallax took the role of Elexetor, a role that would have been your destiny if you hadn't failed. But, that is irrelevant. The worthy are promoted when the weak fall.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004636|I ordered your personal effects disposed of shortly after your crash. Your father took them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004635|We will see who is weak, Tarek.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004634|Who benefitted from my execution?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004633|He would not let family bonds undermine his commitment to the Hybrid and the Directive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004632|Wardek was ever a faithful servant of the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004631|It is something I should have seen earlier. Before he left he called you a bastard. Perhaps he was succumbing to emotion even then.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004630|This is guess work.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004629|Since then, it is clear to me that he has given up Elex and fallen into the madness of emotions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004628|You destroyed his future and left him with the choice of suicide, or exile with the Separatists.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004627|He was shamed by your weakness and his shame at your failures that drove him from the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004626|That you would bring only danger to your people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004625|Wardek said that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004624|He feared that you were not ready for the role you had.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004623|Even your own father recognized that weakness in you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004622|You blame your failures on others.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004621|The Directive does not allow for betrayal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004620|Now, you will tell me why.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004619|I was betrayed by someone here in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004618|The attack on my raider, my execution, it was all planned before I left the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004616|If you think you can face the Hybrid and live you are mistaken.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004615|The shot to your head may not have killed you, but it has obviously damaged your brain. You lost the focus and strength that are the gifts of the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004614|He has no choice.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004613|He will never allow you an audience.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004612|You brought our enemies to our gates.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004611|You betrayed the Directive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004610|You think the Hybrid will speak to you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004609|I will learn the truth when I speak to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004608|The Hybrid will soon complete his work and our people will seize the rewards promised to us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004607|You cannot expect us to step back now we are on the edge of achieving all that we have fought for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004606|You have lost your way, Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004605|Spoken like one of the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004603|Our people committed ourselves to this cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004602|The Directive will bring all of us to the next stage of evolution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004601|Our people pledged our destiny to the Hybrid. We were lost and he gave us purpose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004600|Elex is evolution and we are the people who shall make that leap.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004599|The Free People will be left behind as we ascend to the next level|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004598|You say 'our', but you are talking about the Hybrid's plans.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004597|Our destiny is set.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004596|No, I have learned the truth. The choices the Albs have made will destroy them. You must change the destiny of our people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004595|You truly are misguided.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004594|My own kind betrayed me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004593|The Albs will evolve, but we must control our own destiny.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004592|Elex might have strengthened the Albs in the past, but now it's their weakness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004591|You are nothing but a slave of the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004590|And it seems even now you have not returned to serve the directive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004589|Jax! You have betrayed your comrades.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004588|You have come far, but your journey ends here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004587|When the next Alb raiding party comes down from the north looking for Elex, the people of Goliet will defend you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004586|But, enough talk. You need to decide what you're going to do.|Observing the state of the player character.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004585|I'm going back to Goliet and you can come with me if you like. Safety, security, and you can find work to earn enough to buy equipment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004584|There, that's the gray cabbage I need for the cure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004583|There. This is the gas umbel I need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004582|Let's get on with it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004581|Ready for the fight?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004580|And, you want me along?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004579|Gather the Free People, defeat the Albs and free Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004578|Are you going to stop gloating and tell me what comes next?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004577|Yes. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004576|Full of yourself aren't you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004575|That you now feel better, because it works? And, you're eternally grateful?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004574|Yeah, so... I just wanted to tell you...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004573|Took the medicine?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004572|Hey, you. Listen... I...|Returning, trying to find unfamiliar words of gratitude
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004571|Right. Piss off. Let me think about this in peace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004570|Then we'll kick the ass of anyone left in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004569|You really think this is a cure? What happens when it doesn't work? Then will you leave me alone?|Defensive, worried about allowing herself to leave.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004568|I'm not the one who's ill. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004567|You drink it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004566|Drink it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004565|It even smells like raptorshit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004564|It's a cure. Get it down your neck and stop complaining.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004563|And, now you expect me to swallow this raptorshit?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004562|Some raptorshit from the Clerics' archives?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004561|You know what it's for. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004560|What? What potion? What's it for?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004559|Here, I have a something for you. A potion.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004558|That's the ingredients, but it will take an experienced healer to make the cure... |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004557|And, here is Gray cabbage...'usually be found on grassy hills in the highlands'.. Okay...now I know where to look for the ingredients.|Examining the book and its contents
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004556|Here, 'Gas umbel usually grows in shady, heavily overgrown, low areas'.|Examining the book and its contents
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004555|A book on the plants of Magalan, their structures, life cycles and habitats. Maybe this is what I need...|Examining the book and its contents
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004554|Now, I need a book on plants that will tell me where to find these ingredients...|Continuous to the line above
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004553|Here...' 'Treatments for Gray Death'. This book gives instructions on how to make a remedy for the disease from gas umbel and gray cabbage. |Examining the book and its contents
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004552|Thank you for the instructions, They are sure to come in handy in the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004551|Thank you for your help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004550|Oh, I'd give it a high probability of success, at least seventy percent. The potion has all the right characteristics, but without patients and study, I can't be certain of its effectiveness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004549|You don't think it will?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004548|Here, your potion. I would be interested to know if it works.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004547|You can wait if you like. It won't take long.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004546|Which means there is no time to waste. I will prepare the medicine now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004545|And, I presume you have a sufferer in mind?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004544|I have the ingredients to make the cure for the Gray Death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004543|I'll bring you the ingredients.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004542|Well... It depends on the processes required. But, it would be my duty to try.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004541|If I bring you the ingredients, can you make it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004540|Really? I've heard something about that, but I have never seen the recipe. |Interested
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004539|I have instructions for a potion that will cure Gray Death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004538|I understand.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004537|Here. Here's your cure, you take it. But, I only made it, I don't know if it will work. Okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004536|Wow. Yeah, yeah, well then... Okay, I need some time to make this. Just wait and you'll get it, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004535|Here is the gray cabbage and a gas umbel for the cure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004534|But, will it work? That I can't say.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004533|Yeah, yeah. Get me the ingredients and I'll make this up for you. For a price. I am a businessman after all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004532|But, you need me to get them?|Resigned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004531|Mh... Okay. So... Well, yeah, I could make this if I had the right ingredients...|Considering the formula
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004530|What? Oh, yeah? Then show me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004529|I have the formula for a cure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004528|Ha... Well, then good luck. There is no cure for that that I know of!|With a laugh
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004527|I need a cure for the Gray Death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004526|Some day you are going to tell me the whole story.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004525|You came out of nowhere, just drifting round the wilderness and now you believe you can save all Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004524|You're a believer aren't you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004523|Just don't get killed while I'm getting you a cure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004522|Do what you want.|Putting up a front again.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004521|And, I'll find you a cure in the Cleric's archives. There has to be a clue somewhere in the Hort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004520|Stay with me and keep looking for kicks, if you want.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004519|You didn't believe this would make a difference.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004518|So was coming here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004517|It's fantasy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004516|What if you buy yourself another forty years?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004515|What if I die without finding an answer?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004514|So, what? You think I should spend my days checking the Clerics' archives for legends instead of being out here fighting?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004513|There must be some truth to them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004512|Legends. Le-gends. |Pointing out the problem with this - Deurrrr
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004511|There are legends that speak of a cure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004510|So, either you help me and we kill Parsek, or you let me do it my way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004509|Fuck it. Okay. Yeah, you should know.|Letting the anger out
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004508|That's crazy. Why would I not care? Fuck you, I know more about living than you do.|Objecting, covering the truth. Then getting angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004507|I might as well do something before this thing kills me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004506|So, I might as well do something that makes a difference.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004505|Do you know anyone who has survived it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004504|You're giving up?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004503|And, there's nothing anyone can do about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004502|I've got it. It's terminal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004501|No, I'm making it up. One thing I've heard makes a girl more attractive is the rumor she's got Gray Death.|Angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004500|Gray Death? Are you sure?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004499|I have “Gray Death”.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004498|I fight to win, you don't seem to care about dying.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004497|What are you going on about? I only take the same risks as you.|Evasive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004496|What's going on here? What aren't you telling me?|Realising there is more to this
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004495|What the fuck would you know about being alive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004494|What? You want them to trip over your corpse, because you being dead isn't going to stop them. You need to be alive to stop them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004493|What's the matter with you, can't you be happy that? I believe in the Free People, I want to stop the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004492|Just like that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004491|You wanted to sell me a cause, you've sold it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004490|You told me all of Magalan was in danger, isn't that enough?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004489|What's the rush?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004488|And, you were someone who only cared about Tavar, why the change?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004487|That's a start. Come on, you were the one who got me into this. You must want to finish it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004486|So, happy we're taking action now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004485|The machines I sent certainly won't leave much left over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004484|Your little camp won't offer much hospitality now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004483|Very interesting, but I will have to refuse your offer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004482|Yeah....I've never really done that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004481|You should listen to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004480|But, you shouldn't underestimate him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004479|He is an Elexetor, servant to Tarek, slave to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004478|Well, this guy's an asshole. Who is he?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004477|Send your machines away and I will tell you the whole story at my camp.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004476|You've picked up the habits and speech of the Free People, Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004475|Reward? We work for duty not reward.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004474|Yes. It looks like you could get yourself the whole reward for my capture. Parsek.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004473|The whole of Xacor must've heard the rumors about you by now. Jax. Back from the dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004472|You don't know how much running around I've had to do to get here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004471|So, my scouts did report the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004470|And that means I'll lose my base.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004469|We should find Parsek soon. If he comes through the pass then he must want to attack Origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004468|Then, let's make it quick. Time is running out...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004467|You're right, we should stop Elexetor Parsek before he finds us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004466|Sound like a plan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004465|Then let's get there and kill the bastard.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004464|Maybe it's about both.|Playing off her line
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004463|You'd better stay where I can see you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004462|Maybe it's about both.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004461|Yeah, maybe. Maybe, I've started listening to you. Maybe fighting for Abessa can help save Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004460|So, this new belief in the Free People is really about facing off against Elexetor Parsek?|Realising she is just looking for a fight/challenge
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004459|I know Elexetor Parsek is leading the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004458|Really? What do you know about this fight?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004457|Since when were you interested in Abessa? I thought it was only Tavar you care about.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004456|Yes, we should look into it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004455|In Abessa?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004454|I'd say the Albs are about to march over the pass in the Central Mountains of Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004453|I haven't seen them myself, but that's what reports are saying.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004452|Are you sure?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004451|There are Alb fighting machines in Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004450|Yes?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004449|Hey. I have to talk to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004448|You stagnate you might as well be dead. Turn it up, live it fast, make it fucking count. Now, are we done here, or what?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004447|You don't live you stagnate.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004446|You don't risk you don't live.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004445|But, don't get us killed|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004444|You can get a challenge.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004443|I'm not running round with you to take down a few creatures. Let's do something that makes a real fucking difference.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004442| I thought you were a fighter. I spend enough time just standing around in the Fort. I took that place, I did. So, show me another damn challenge and stop wasting my time.|Letting out some frustration (she knows she's got limited time left alive and wants to live it!)
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004441|I'm trying to get the job done. If you can't keep up, fuck off.|Impatient
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004440|What are you doing rushing into combat like that? Are you trying to get us killed?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004439|Not soon enough for me. Let's kill these fuckers and go home.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004438|We'll get to them soon enough.|Calm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004437|Mutants, cyclops, they'll do for a start! But, you promised Alb Elexetors.|Pleased with the challenge, but wanting more.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004436|Just get your ass moving and get on with it!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004435|No waiting. We're not out here to wait, we came to fight.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004434|Wait a second. First we should...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004433|Two cyclops. Let's take them down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004432|Well, it seems as if the rumors are true.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004431|It might just be them disrupting the forces there rather than invading.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004430|Mutants aren't an organized force, they're just a pack of dogs to unleash.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004429|Someone in Xacor wants to secure the west.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004428|I don't know, but there's at least two cyclops with them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004427|How many?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004426|We've heard a horde of mutants is approaching the border to Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004425|It's also suicide without a plan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004424|Well, that's certainly a challenge.|With a laugh
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004423|Fight the leaders of the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004422|How about taking the fight to the Alb Elexetors in Xacor, would that be a big enough challenge?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004421|But, if you come to me with a plan...sure, why not. Fuck it, let's destroy the Albs, just the two of us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004420|But, okay. If you find me a good enough challenge, something to...really shake shit up. I'll think about it.|Bored with life, needing a challenge.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004419|Because, challenge and profit is all I'm looking for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004418|You are talking and profit here, right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004417|We make a good team.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004416|There are more challenges out there. We will find them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004415|Is killing creatures all we're going to do?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004414|But, it didn't. So, here we are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004413|That thing could've killed both of us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004412|We didn't need them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004411|Why didn't we bring more men?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004410|Yeah, we'll if you insist on knowing what the Albs are planning, but, this had better mean combat and not just a look see.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004409|We need to go there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004408|But, it takes more than blood to make you a relation. |Diplomatic, but clear she doesn't respect him.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004407|William works for the Duke. He gets things done his way. I get things done my way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004406|William's my cousin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004405|So, the Duke is your brother? Is he your own relation here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004404|Fucking William. If it's not shards lying on the sand, he can't understand the true worth of it.|Dismissive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004403|You sound like William. Runners might be expendable, but we can't make a profit without them. |Dismissive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004402|El Colosaro. That thing was killing our Runners.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004401|Why couldn't they take care of it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004400|Ha, let's see if you've got the legs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004399|We go down there together, we fight together, we stick together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004398|Yeah, you and me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004397|You want to go down there now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004396|So be careful and give him everything you've got.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004395|What makes him so dangerous isn't just his strength, it's how clever he is when fighting.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004394|Yes. Most of our guys just run from it. Pissants.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004393|And, obviously, they lost.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004392|We've sent several teams to find him and kill him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004391|There he is. El Colosaro. The terror of our Runners.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004390|Does that scare you? Are you scared of a challenge? Come on, we'll take care of this alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004389|We? Is this just the two of us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004388|Come on, let's get this job done!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004387|I'll show you when we're there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004386|I am ready. What is it about?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004385|Ready to go?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004384|And. here you are, back again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004383|We'll soon find out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004382|Maybe, Tavar does have a use for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004381|Come and see me when you've recovered.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004380|That's a start.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004379|Did I pass your test?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004378|Stop talking, start killing these things.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004377|Okay, so stop talking about it and make it happen.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004376|Yeah, I can handle that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004375|What you have to do now is simple: Go there and kill them. Think you can handle that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004374|So, friend. As you can see, that area over there is infested by large, ugly creatures with a taste for human flesh.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004373|Okay, I'll see you outside, in front of the city.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004372|I'm ready to go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004371|We're going to finish my business and until then, I don't care what the Clerics are doing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004370|So? What does that have to do with me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004369|The Clerics are planning a big offensive against the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004368|I have news from Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004367|This is the time to prove it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004366|Okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004365|And, that it's worth the Duke keeping you on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004364|This is the way you prove to me you're ready to stay.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004363|Do I have a choice?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004362|When do we go?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004361|Not interested.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004360|Then, we'll find out who you really are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004359|We're going on a little trip you and me.|Considering and then laying a challenge.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004358|If you want me to stay, you have to give me a reason to stay.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004357|Maybe, I'll stay to blow things up.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004356|You want to ask me if I'll blow away? Come on, you can do better than that.|Trying to get on her good side, snark.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004355|You've got a lot of mouth haven't you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004353|Question is, are you going to stay and help build things here in the Fort, or blow out of here as quickly as you blew in?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004352|Yet here you are, already getting people to trust you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004351|Yeah?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004350|You are making enemies here, you know that? Some people are getting upset by your successes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004349|I've heard about what you've been doing here. You've blown into Tavar and stirred things up. Most newcomers start at the bottom and take years to crawl up.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004348|I was told to speak to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004347|All right, then I'll speak to her.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004346|Oh, yes. Yes, you want to speak to her.|Insistent
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004345|Does she? And do I want to speak to her?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004344|Hey, you. Nasty wants to speak to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004343|Touch nothing, mess with nothing and nothing will happen to you. Understood?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004342|Don't do anything stupid, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004341|Thank you for looking for me.|Observing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004340|I won't let him surprise me like that again.|Grateful
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004339|Well, why ever he left me alive, it was a mistake.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004338|That explains the disturbance in the Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004337|But, you must've been too strong for him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004336|It must have been part of his plan to regain his place in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004335|He must have wanted to use your strength.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004334|Why didn't he just kill me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004333|I don't know. He hasn't been here for a long time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004332|Where is he? Where is Zardom?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004331|He must've planned that all along.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004330|That bastard paralyzed me and left me here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004329|Well, then he must have got what he wanted, that means he's gone to the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004328|In Zardom's hideout. On the border between Abessa and Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004327|The feel of this place, it is terrible. Where are we?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004326|I knew Zardom must have brought you here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004325|That is helpful, but I will need more|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004324|I need help. If I'm not to get lost. If you don't help me, if you don't help me soon then I am gone. Please, please get me the Mana I need!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004323|The deeper I get into the Elex, the more I'm afraid I won't come out again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004322|I still don't have enough Mana. I feel like I'm losing part of myself.|This should be more energetic, as the problem is getting bigger.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004318|The effects of communicating with the Elex is clouding my mind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004313|Please, wait...I...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004312|If I don't, I think I will lose part of myself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004311|I need to get hold of some Mana and soon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004310|I need it to balance the Elex I'm sensing. Without it, I'm worried I'll lose myself to it. I have to understand what it wants. What the Elex's purpose is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004309|Thank you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004308|That's good of you. I will prepare it later.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004307|Here, I have some Mana for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004306|But, otherwise the only place to get hold of it is in Goliet at the Mana shrine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004305|You can find it occasionally, if you are lucky.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004304|Where do you get your Mana when you need it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004303|Wait.|Pained
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004302|Don't worry about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004301|Yes?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004300|About the side effects of Elex...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004299|You're right. Part of its power is that it isn't from here. I want to discover how it has spread across Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004298|We've picked up on these differences and made more Elex that's the same. I think it changes our thoughts too.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004297|Elex created us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004296|Whatever powers I have, that you have, we owe to Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004295|And, I don't know if it is serving us, or we are serving it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004294|But, whatever comes next, I know I couldn't have got here without you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004293|Thank you for your help, I know now that what I felt, what I have been feeling was real. I just need some time to think what that means for us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004292|Whatever my powers are, they aren't close to that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004291|I can't decide that now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004290|You don't have to face it alone. Whatever this is, we can fight it. Together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004289|How can you not be afraid of that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004288|Whatever Elex is, something must have created it. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004287|Don't you see?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004286|With all your magic?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004285|Knowing what I know now. It makes me feel powerless.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004284|I almost wish I hadn't.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004283|I've learned more than I imagined I would.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004282|Getting close to it, inside what it is projecting, it would be easy to get swept away.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004281|Not right now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004280|Do you think you can find out more from the Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004279|But, whatever purpose it has, the Free People will be less able to resist it while they are divided into all these factions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004278|No. Not yet anyway. Maybe with more study I can learn more.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004277|I know. I always assumed it was about magic, or just an excuse for their belief that they were superior. But, I think the Elex wants to change us. The question is...why?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004276|Can you figure this out?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004274|The Albs think Elex is the key to the next step in evolution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004273|And now we all depend on it, for magic, for technology, for power. The whole planet is dependent on it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004272|The power it must have taken to make this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004271|But, whatever Elex's purpose is, it isn't over. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004270|I don't know, I can only tell you what I sensed from the Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004269|Sent here by who?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004268|I am still trying to understand it myself. But, I'm sure that Elex was sent here to change things.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004267|It sounds crazy doesn't it?|Recovering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004266|I know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004265|You think it's alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004264|I know, but I can feel it, it has purpose. It almost has reason.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004263|Elex came here on the Comet. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004262|It didn't come here by accident.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004261|Meant to change our planet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004260|The Elex was meant to change us.|Dazed, in a semi-trnce
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004259|What are you talking about?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004258|Yes... The Elex is...it is more than just energy, it has purpose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004257|Were you able to feel anything this time?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004256|I think... It's all right, it's all right, I'm back. I'm with you.|Recovering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004255|What happened?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004254|It is easy to get lost in it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004253|Give me space and I will see what I can find.|Nervous about what she might find
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004252|Here. It's here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004251|It is somewhere up ahead of us. We are close now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004250|We know where we have to go. I'll follow you this time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004249|Well, there is still enough here for us to examine. We should begin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004248|And today the Factions are gathering it back up.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004247|The impact sent it high into the atmosphere and spread it across the word.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004246|The Crater. This is where the Comet struck. Where Elex first appeared on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004245|Good, good, thank you. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004244|Let's take a look at the Elex deposit in Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004243|Yes, we should go there. Now, as soon as possible.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004242|You've sensed more Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004241|I will find it when I am close.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004240|Go where in Ignadon?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004239|Ignadon...we must go to Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004238|I will see if I can sense anything.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004237|I am not sure yet. Let me think about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004236|Do you know of any other Elex deposits like this?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004235|That Elex changes the people it interacts with.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004234|Processed, organized here. Raw, unaligned Mana in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004233|Rational, emotional, it's tuned to us and us to it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004232|Yes. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004231|The Elex in Xacor is different from in Edan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004230|I hadn't felt that before, but I can now. Especially now I can feel how similar the Elex here is to processed Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004229|It's similar to Mana.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004228|Conscious, or not the Elex is changing us. The Elex in Edan is polarized one way. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004227|What does that mean?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004226|As if it had been processed by Alb converters.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004225|That was difficult...the Elex here is... polarized, close to the Elex that's been refined.|Recovering, processing what she experienced.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004224|Okay. I am ready.|Exhausted from the experience
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004223|We will have to get up there somehow I'm afraid. Stay close to me. We aren't alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004222|Come on. I want to get out of here as quickly as we can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004221|I will follow the trail, but I will need you to watch my back, again, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004220|And yet for all their efforts they have missed a concentration of Elex here in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004219|There must be huge amounts of it there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004218|That must be the Elex the Albs have collected in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004217|The Elex. I can hear it everywhere. It's overwhelming.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004216|Just give me some space. I will try to make this quick.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004215|It is cold. Bitterly cold. More than usual for this place. We must be in the right place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004214|All right. We're close to the Elex and I know we're close to answers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004213|I know Xacor. I'm ready to go there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004212|We should make sure we are properly equipped before we go looking for Elex there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004211|But, the deposit is close to an Alb position in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004210|Yes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004209|More traces of Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004208|Hey! I think I have something!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004207|Just give me a little time. as soon as I can locate it, I'll tell you where we need to go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004206|I know of another place we can try, but it is likely to be pretty dangerous. These big Elex deposits always are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004205|Yes, there was...there was something there, in the background when I probed that Elex deposit, but I don't know what it is that I felt, not yet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004204|Do you still need to find more traces of Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004203|Maybe, you can resist whatever the Elex is trying to do. Whereas I look at these mutants and I wonder...is that going to be me one day?|Concerned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004202|I bet you could achieve anything you put your mind to.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004201|You're strong, mentally I mean.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004200|Yeah. You should know people who keep their word like that are rare.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004199|I do what I say.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004198|Lucky? I thought I was going crazy. Thank you, for coming with me to this place. When you said you'd help me, I wasn't sure about you, but you've been true to your word.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004197|You just got lucky.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004196|Why did this talent pick me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004195|I thought it must affect other people on some level at least.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004194|Maybe it is just me. I could sense something here, but...but I don't yet know what it means.|Realising she is alone in her power
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004193|No.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004192|Don't you feel anything at all?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004191|Give me a moment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004190|Are you all right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004189|I...wait... I can hardly breathe.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004188|Did it work?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004187|Stand guard for me. I'll see what I can sense.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004186|Either I am getting more attuned to the Elex, or this is the biggest deposit I have ever found.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004185|The Elex is here. |Pained
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004184|But, this much Elex has got to have pulled in a lot of mutants. Getting there won't be straightforward.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004183|There is a lot of Elex up there. I can hear it already.|Fighting the feeling, trying not to be overwhelmed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004182|We're getting close now. The deposit has to be up there somewhere!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004181|I'll follow the traces. You keep an eye out for mutants!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004180|We've come too far not to, but I will need to focus on the Elex. I will need you to deal with any combat, or I will lose my contact with the Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004179|If the traces are weak, maybe we should try somewhere else?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004178|That means I'll need your help again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004177|There are only weak traces here. I will need all my concentration not to lose the trail.|Sensing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004176|It has to go differently this time, I have to learn more.|To herself, determined
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004175|Yes, follow me. It's on the east border of Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004174|Very well. Let's find the deposit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004173|It feels like it will be big enough to allow me to learn more.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004172|It's...up on the high borderlands, between Edan and Tavar.|Focusing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004171|I want to check it out, to see if I can learn anything from it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004170|Where is this deposit?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004169|Hey, wait, wait. I can feel traces of an Elex deposit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004168|Let's go, I'll tell you if I sense any.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004167|Some that have been brought back up from when the Comet first hit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004166|We need to find some more Elex deposits.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004165|You of all people ask me that? You know the effect it had on you as an Alb. You've seen what it's done to Magalan's animal life.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004164|Hey, what? How can it be changing us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004163|Closer, yes, but I need to know more to understand it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004162|I want to know if we're changing it, or it's changing us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004161|The fact Elex is alive, that is has a collective consciousness is one thing, but we need to know what it wants.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004160|Are you any closer to understanding what this means?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004159|It's conceivable. But, nobody knows how to do it. Not even the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004158|Mana can become pure Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004157|...and that it can revert. It can return to its unrefined form.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004156|That all its forms must be related and...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004155|So, what does that mean?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004154|It might change the way Elex behaves, but it remains linked together somehow.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004153|It retains the same 'voice'.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004152|Processed, Transmuted. It doesn't matter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004151|It doesn't matter whether it's been changed. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004150|The Elex, it's alive.|Feeling it, figuring it out.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004149|What can you hear?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004148|It's incredible. I can hear something here, clearer than before.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004147|What can you sense?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004146|I can sense it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004145|Can you give me some space again? I need peace and quiet for meditation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004144|I have to go on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004143|It's terrible. Not a soul here. Just death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004142|Maybe it was mutants. They are attracted to Mana as well as Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004141|Then we should be ready for a fight. Something has killed the guards here.|Cautious, concerned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004140|Doesn't look like anyone's home.|Cautious, concerned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004139|There should be guards to look after the World Heart.|Cautious, concerned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004138|Something is wrong here.|Cautious, concerned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004137|Alright.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004136|Then let's go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004135|Now that you're here we could go together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004134|I do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004133|I thought you wanted to go to a World Heart.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004132|I need some now. I need to get some Mana.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004131|I got similar feelings when I took Mana. I can't imagine what it did to you before being transmuted...|Sympathetic
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004130|You remember it, right? From when you took it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004129|Cold? That sounds like Elex.|Recalling his time as an Alb.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004128|It's like I it looked inside of me. I feel cold from the inside.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004127|That encounter with the Elex in Abessa really took a lot out of me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004126|Yeah, I know. I feel terrible.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004125|Are you okay? You look...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004124|Hey. There you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004123|The one south of the observatory in the middle of Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004122|Right...See you in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004121|You go. I'll meet you there when I can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004120|Can't you see how important this could be? What this would mean for everyone?|Appealing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004119|Because, I need to be sure. I need to know I'm not, I wasn't going crazy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004118|You said you felt something back then, why would it be different now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004117|Now, I've heard it, sensed it here, I want to know if this is what I heard when I was close large amounts of Mana in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004116|I have to go to Edan, to one of our World Hearts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004115|But, first I need to return...home.|Hesitant about using the word home, it's not been that for a long time
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004114|We go Elex hunting.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004113|But, it was fleeting, hard to catch.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004111|I think I need to find a bigger deposit of Elex, that might help me hear it more clearly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004110|I am not sure. It wasn't words, more a sense of desire, of purpose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004109|Let's assume I believe you: What exactly do you think you heard?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004108|Okay. What happens now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004107|Are you still up for this? Now you know how crazy my idea is?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004106|You said you would help me. That was our deal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004105|So, you want to continue?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004104|That's one of the reasons I had to leave Goliet, it was like the Elex was screaming to me. I thought it was because of the Mana they were giving me, but now I know it's something different.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004103|How can it speak to you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004102|But, it's a mineral, how can it want something?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004101|I know how crazy that sounds. But, it's true.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004100|Elex speaks to you?|Doubtful
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004099|I could feel the Elex was communicating with me. Like if has a purpose. That it wants something from me, from the people on this planet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004098|It's something I've suspected, it's why I came it's...the reason you're going to think I'm crazy.|Thoughts spilling from her.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004097|That doesn't sound good.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004096|That was what I was afraid of.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004095|Please, don't disturb me. I need to focus.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004094|That was...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004093|I must meditate. Wait over there, I need space away from you.|Preparing herself.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004092|And so what do we do now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004091|The deposit must be here. I can feel the Elex in the ground.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004090|I am better at sensing Elex than any person I know. But, there are mutants with the same ability. We should be careful in case the Elex deposit has attracted them.|Admission. Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004089|That makes the background noise from it hard to read. If I am to learn more, we must follow those mutants to find where the Elex is coming from.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004088|Yes, from the moment the Comet struck Elex has been seeping into everything on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004087|But, you still think we need to find concentrations of it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004086|It washes out of the cliffs and the ground. And it flows out across the planet. Elex is everywhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004085|There is a vast amount of Elex flowing into the sea .|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004084|It's not far from the city. Follow me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004083|All right. Show me the way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004082|Come with me and find out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004081|Your senses are better than Alb technology?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004080|I don't know. Maybe because nobody can feel Elex like I can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004079|If it's so close why hasn't anyone else found it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004078|The first deposit I'd like to investigate is north of the city of Abessa. I can show you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004077|Where can you find this unrefined Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004076|But it has collected and concentrated in some places.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004075|I have felt the vibrations, the presence of these deposits. I want to track them down and examine them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004074|Into the seas, the rock, the air we breathe.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004073|When the Comet impact spread Elex across Magalan it found its way everywhere. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004072|How do you want to find these large Elex deposits?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004071|To understand those secrets, I need is untouched, pure Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004070|That keeps some of its power, but it's the Elex that came with the Comet that I want to learn more about. I feel that it, that there are secrets to learn about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004069|The transmuted form that the Berserkers get from their Mana shrine changes it in similar ways.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004068|It becomes...polarized.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004067|But, when it is processed by the Albs, the Elex changes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004066|Deposits? I thought Elex arrived with the Comet?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004065|I want to explore Magalan and look for some large deposits of unrefined Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004064|No, I'm talking about unrefined Elex. When it's raw, latent. I can learn more from it when it hasn't be altered.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004063|You don't need any special powers to feel the Elex there. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004062|Like the Converter?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004061|I can feel the presence of Elex. Mostly where it is present in great quantities.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004060|You said you want to study the properties of Elex. How will you do that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004059|Now can we talk about my problem?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004058|Or, we have.|Adding herself in.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004057|You've done a lot, but you still have got a lot of work ahead of you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004056|Okay, I'll tell you what has happened so far.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004055|So you are. And, are you planning on telling me where you've set up camp, or what comes next? Or, do I have to wait for that too?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004054|Not without a mage to help control the energy. I require Caja to assist me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004053|She will? And, is she ready now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004052|Why don't you ask yourself?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004051|That is more important than this?! Tell her to hurry, this is the fate of Magalan that is at stake.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004050|Not yet, she has another task to finish first.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004049|You have a point.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004048|My guess is, that he's gone back to the Ice Palace. I mean, why else would he try and kill you, it has to be with Xacor, right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004047|I don't know. I really don't.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004046|Where is Zardom now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004045|But, hey, doesn't that describe us all? I mean look at me with some random someone wanting me dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004044|You should talk to them. They're lost like you. Stuck between their past and working out what they want to be.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004043|Yes, there is a settlement between Abessa and Edan of... Well, a mixed bag of people. Berserkers, Outlaws, wanderers, people trying to get away from the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004042|Weird camp?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004041|Yeah, that's what those guys up in that weird camp were saying.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004040|You're making yourself pretty visible for someone on the run.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004039|Complicated. Maybe, I'll tell it to you one day.|Hiding his fears
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004038|What's the full story?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004037|At the moment, Tom is... well, let's say he is not around.|Hiding his fears
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004036|What about your brother? Can't he help you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004035|Right.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004034|Oh no. He's much worse. I'm always having to get him out of trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004033|Is he as messed up as you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004032|Yes. Tom. He's all that's left of my family.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004031|You have a brother?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004030|It seems my brother was right. You really are normal people behind your frozen facade.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004029|Walter is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004028|Jackson is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004027|Bomby is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004026|Mason is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004025|Did you check him? What did he have on him? We need to know if he's the guy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004023|Leo is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004022|Yeah, let's hope we find the rest before someone tries to collect on it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004021|We still haven't found all the copies of the contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004020|Just stay calm, we'll make it through, yeah?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004019|Mh... Then maybe that screw up did get his life to mean something in the end. I wish I'd been there to see that.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004018|He sacrificed himself for the Free People of Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004017|My brother Ray, he didn't make it?|Upset
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004016|I... have to get my thoughts together. I, my mind is still a bit of a mess.|Confused.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004015|And Zardom, he was going to kill my brother. You have to understand that.|Pleading
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004014|But... How can we find Tom?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004013|We'll know for certain if we can find him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004012|But... Are you sure? You could be wrong, he could be lying.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004011|He's among us. Hiding in plain sight. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004010|I think Zardom turned your brother into a jackal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004009|What? What are you talking about?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004008|Now, I understand the note I read about changing a person into a jackal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004007|I couldn't tell you because of that, he is still threatening him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004006|I do?|Cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004005|Yes. I didn't know you, you were my enemy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004004|He took your brother? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004003|He has my brother, Tom. He said he would kill him if I didn't help. He still has him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004002|And, I didn't even get paid. He threatened me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004001|I mean at that point, you were just another Alb. Now I know you and I know you're more than that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00004000|It wasn't personal. Not from me. I took a job. A strange one, I didn't know who was hiring me. I was told to aim at the port on your raider, they gave me that information.|Talking fast to save his own life.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003999|Yeah, I know, but listen, I had a reason and nothing I can do now is going to change the past.|Talking quickly
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003998|I'm listening.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003997|You didn't give me a choice, you tried to kill me you asshole!|Angry humane minus two cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003996|I had no choice. Please, listen to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003995|Yes, and I can't thank you enough for that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003994|Obviously, I found out just in time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003993|In your contract with Zardom I found the magical trigger that Zardom planted in your brother to turn him back.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003992|Okay, but hurry up before someone accidentally shoots Tom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003991|Yes, and I think I know how.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003990|What? We should go there now. We have to help him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003989|I think that jackal is your brother.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003988|There is a friendly jackal at Origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003987|What? Where? Tell me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003986|We still have a lot to. So... Get your head into straight. And let's get on with it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003985|That pledge is the only thing keeping me going.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003984|And, I will pay off my debt to you. To the last shard. To the last drop of blood. I promise you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003983|Of course, you tried to help me. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003982|You'd better be talking about Zardom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003981|All this, you have to understand I didn't know you and now...my brother...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003980|Oh, what have I done? Why did I deal with Zardom?|Upset that he did business with zardom and that it's led to this.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003979|Unfortunately, it seems I found out just too late.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003978|When did you realize that jackal was my brother?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003977|I can't...I need to...Can you leave me alone?|Devastated
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003976|That's how it looks.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003975|All this time searching for him. The attack on you? And Zardom had left him to die like that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003974|No, it can't be...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003973|I think that jackal was your brother.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003972|There was a friendly jackal in the middle of Origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003971|What...? How...?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003970|I think he is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003969|Afraid? What is that supposed to mean?|Guessing the fate of his brother.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003968|I'm afraid I already know where your brother is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003967|You don't need to say anything.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003966|You, of all people got him back. After everything. I...I don't know what to say.|Almost speechless with gratitude
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003965|ORION!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003964|We're going to get you out of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003963|Come here, boy.|As if talking to a dog.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003962|I've never met one like this before.|To self, puzzled.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003961|A tame jackal?|To self, puzzled.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003960|I think I know where your brother is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003959|Just sit down. You'll be fine, all right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003958|It's alright. The important thing is you are back again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003957|I... I can't remember what happened.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003956|Zardom. He transformed you into a jackal. But you're back now. You don't have an urge to scratch your ear with your foot do you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003955|What happened? The last thing I knew, was that... that Elexetor...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003954|Slow down. You're still a little dazed after what you went through.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003953|What...? Ray? Is that you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003952|Why did you do it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003951|I should have told you earlier . But, you were so pissed about your armor, I thought, well, you'll probably kill me if you did.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003950|Oh, well, yeah. The shit with your raider, yeah? I'm, sorry. I was the guy that shot you out of the sky.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003949|You know who I am talking about.|Not amused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003948|Zardom? Za-rdom?|As if trying to recall the name.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003947|Zardom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003946|Okay, that tone is telling me something is wrong. Are you going to give me a clue?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003945|Ray. There's something you should have told me. Now is the time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003944|Jackals...if Outlaws were to come back to life as animals...this is what they'd be.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003943|But, it doesn't seem so bad now. It hasn't tried to eat anyone, or anything, so, you know, as long as it doesn't take a shit on my tools, it's fine to stay.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003942|I have no idea where that thing came from. It just turned up here one day. Scared the living shit out of me to be honest.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003941|That jackal over there, is that your pet?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003940|So?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003939|Let's hear it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003938|I think I know how to find the guy behind these wanted posters.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003937|I'll have to look into this and tell you if I find anything new, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003936|Oh, yeah? Then it's time to find him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003935|He is in southern Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003934|I think I've met this Cleric, Walter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003933|Now, you've got what you wanted, so leave me alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003932|All right, maybe I'll ask him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003931|Just tell me what you want and leave me alone!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003930|Let's see where he crawls off to.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003929|I guess I should follow him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003928|Hey, man. Back here. He's making a run for it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003927|It seems Walter has something better to do than talk to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003926|I've heard he might be in south Ignadon. He's staying clear of the Hort somewhere near the border with Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003925|Maybe. It's the best guess we've got. But, it's still a guess for now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003924|So, these contracts were taken out as revenge for the death of his friends?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003923|It seems that he's got a long memory. And a weird sense of justice. Him and his friends attacked me. I just happened to be the better shot.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003922|Tell me something about your Cleric friend.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003921|Then we're going to South Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003920|Let's go to Walter. We should find out if he is behind this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003919|We should find him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003918|That's what I'm trying to find out. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003917|Why is a Cleric going to these lengths to see you dead?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003916|Just that he has a grudge, I need more details.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003915|What stories?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003914|Whoever it is isn't in the desert, they're not in Tavar. What I'm hearing are stories about some Cleric, a guy called Walter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003913|If it isn't Jackson who took the contract out then I don't know who it could be.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003912|We still don't know who took the hit out on you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003911|You don't need to worry about Jackson anymore. But, if he was carrying a copy of the contact, then he isn't the one behind this|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003910|It looks like there are already 5 in circulation...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003909|The contract taken out on Ray...five sheets from a set of ten.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003908|That you can be sure of. Bastard deserves it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003907|If you want him dead, you take care of him.|He's allowing Ray to kill Walter.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003906|You are too soft sometimes, you know that right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003905|But, remember that Raptor ass took out a contract on me. Several contracts. He wanted me dead. So, you can understand that I'm pissed about that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003904|All right, all right, we'll play it your way.|Frustrated
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003903|I made my decision, Walter lives.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003902|He wanted me dead! He tried to have me killed! How can I be safe if he's still alive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003901|Hey, listen, I didn't agree to that!|Angry to discover that Walter is still alive.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003900|Yes, and you're going to go along with my decision.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003899|What? You're letting him off?!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003898|You didn't leave me alone did you? I've had to live in fear of my life you scrag-assed skinflap.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003897|I can't leave you alive, for all I know you will send someone after my head.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003896|Yes, here, take them. You can have all of them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003895|You want to buy your way out?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003894|You bastards. I hope you rot in hell!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003893|You weren't so squeamish when you took a contract out on Ray's life.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003892|Oh, no. Please... I'll give you all of the shards I've got.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003891|Why don't you ask him why I did it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003890|You're working for that son of a bitch?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003889|You're going to pay for taking out those contracts.|Threat
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003888|That's all of them! I promise!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003887|If I see so much as one of these in circulation, I'll come back and skin you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003886|There were ten. I gave five out, this is all that's left.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003885|Yes, that's all of them. Honestly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003884|Is this all of them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003883|You will? Okay, yes, here, take them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003882|Give me the rest of the contracts you've got left and we'll forget about this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003881|Let's start with you telling me why you took that contract out on Ray.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003880|Listen, I can give you shards. Just leave me alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003879|So, you're the one who took out the contract on Ray and sent those bounty hunters after him?|Confirming this information
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003878|Ah, shit.|Giving up
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003877|If I just ignore you... Will you go way?|Scared
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003876|You can try closing your eyes and wishing, but I'll still be here when you open your eyes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003875|So, this is your hiding place?|In control
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003874|And I don't know anything about any contract being taken out on either of them, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003873|What? Who? Walter? No, I don't know anyone with those names.|Nervous protestation
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003872|I'm looking for Walter, Ray sent me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003871|So, just pretend I wasn't even here, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003870|That doesn't matter. I don't have anything for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003869|Stop, answer my question. Who are you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003868|Arrgh... No, he found me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003867|Look, listen, I just...have to go!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003866|Um... I... I am just passing through.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003865|I wanted to ask you that exact question.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003864|What...? No... Who are you? What do you want here?|Nervous
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003863|Um... Yes, I... uh... I have work to do, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003862|Alright, then let's get started.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003861|Yeah, I suppose that's the only way if I want this over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003860|You really want to comb through the entire area here, looking for him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003859|Then let's get started.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003858|Well, here we are now. All we need to do is find Walter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003857|But, he could also be anywhere by now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003856|He is a character, huh? I know he was looking for me in Abessa. |Amused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003855|I've met Bomby.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003854|Right.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003853|He's still got that contract. I need that back.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003852|You think they're still a danger?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003851|His camp is near the dam in Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003850|It seems the whole gang wants to be clear of Tavar. They've probably made too many enemies here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003849|I've met Jackson.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003848|Your choice.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003847|Jackson's dangerous. If we find him, maybe it will be the end of me. Maybe, we shouldn't be looking for trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003846|Jackson's hideout is there. Let's go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003845|Yeah. Maybe. But, no...no I should go and see his face when he sees mine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003844|You are free to stay here. I will speak with Jackson.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003843|Shit, that's Jackson's hideout. Jackson. He's really there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003842|I get the feeling he and me might not have the happiest of reunions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003841|Oh, yeah and if I were you, I wouldn't spend any more time near Ray.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003840|Here is payment, as promised.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003839|Alright. That's all pretty useful. And I believe you. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003838|No, you can deal with what you've got yourself into.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003837|Hey, cool it you two.|Intervening
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003836|After what you did, you shitweed?!|Angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003835|What can I say? I must've been homesick.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003834|You're brave, or just plain stupid to show up here like this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003833|Well, let's see what have we got here? The prodigal son returns!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003832|That is bold. I'll look forward to see how you manage that.|Calm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003831|If you won't give me that contract I'll take it from you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003830|No, no, this isn't for sale. I told you, Ray is my man, this is my business.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003829|I'll buy the contract from you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003828|Well, before you start turning hostile, you'd better start thinking about where you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003827|You're not interested in Ray, you're only interested in the reward. So cut the raptor shit and give me the contract.|Not buying it
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003826|I have been looking for him for a long time after all. And you needn't worry, I just want to make sure he's properly taken of.|Concillatory
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003825|Ray was one of my men. So, the way I see it is I should be the one to collect on him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003824|You're going to give me that contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003823|But, why do you care?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003822|Okay, sure. I know about that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003821|Drop the act, you know about the contract that's been taken out on him.|Accusation
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003820|Is that a fact? Well, Ray is no blank sheet. I'm not surprised he's got himself into trouble again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003819|Ray is a wanted man.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003818|Mh... Must've been one of those guards. I told you it was dangerous here. We'd better get on. Quickly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003817|No, I don't know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003816|Yeah, well...fuck it...let's drop it. I think we have something better to do than go over old ground.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003815|You're not dead yet are you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003814|You'd have me killed over a suit of dented, secondhand armor that failed to save your life?!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003813|Let's call it payback for the armor you stole.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003812|Yeah? Fuck. I hope he paid you well for it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003811|I told Jackson you were here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003810|Yeah... I guess that won't make me any less 'wanted'... You don't happen to have an idea how he knew I was here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003809|So, he's dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003808|Well, he... Let's just say that his current condition will prevent him from reporting to his boss.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003807|Where is Jackson's man now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003806|Shortly before you showed up here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003805|How long ago was that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003804|One of Jackson's men already tried to take me out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003803|We're very anxious to find him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003802|That's a shame. Well, if you do come across him come back and let me know won't you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003801|You can? Then, let's talk. I want to hear everything you know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003800|I can tell you where Ray is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003799|So, mull it over. Let me know what you think.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003798|Let's say if your information means I find our man, then I'll pay you 300 shards.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003797|You want payment? That's fair enough. I'll pay anything fair to make sure he's all right.|Sounding reasonable
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003796|What would information about Ray be worth to you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003795|I have no idea where Ray is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003794|You don't happen to know where he is? It would be good to find him before trouble catches up with him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003793|Oh, has he got himself in trouble? That would explain why he's missing. What's he gone and done now?|Maintaining his pretence of concern.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003792|You aren't the first person I've met who is looking for him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003791|Ah, so you have heard of him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003790|Ray is a pretty popular man.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003789|He likes to talk so he can listen to himself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003788|You'd remember if you'd met him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003787|His name is Ray. He comes across as an idiot, but underneath that he is a crafty, old dog.|Friendly
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003786|Your missing man, what is his name?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003785|We are starting to worry, you see?|Calm, starting to fish
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003784|You haven't heard anything about him have you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003783|And he hasn't reported back for several days now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003782|He went out on a job.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003781|Although, that said, one of my men has gone missing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003780|Trade? Why not? Show me what you have.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003779|Do you have anything to trade?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003778|There's certainly enough to keep us busy, but we manage to get by.|Relaxed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003777|Isn't it dangerous up here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003776|Everything necessary to survive in this harsh land.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003775|But, then I suppose I should ask you why you care about what we're doing?|An edge creeping in
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003774|What exactly are you all doing here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003773|Leaders, leadership, who is in charge, always complex issues those aren't they?|Relaxed, sidestepping
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003772|Are you in charge around here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003771|Are you looking for something specific out here in the wild?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003770|Well... You could say that, in the broadest sense, my friend. In the broadest sense.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003769|What is this place? Are you mining minerals here?|Observing the area, which looks like a mine
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003768|A traveler? Welcome, welcome. Come and rest at our fire and share your news.|Warm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003767|Be careful who you trust.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003766|Let's see what he has to say.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003765|I bet he is in his hovel over there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003764|Hey, chill your boots, Bomby will be, you know...somewhere round here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003763|I didn't come all this way for 'somewhere'.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003761|Bomby should be around here somewhere. Somewhere...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003760|Mh... A contract, 'not wanted alive, wanted dead'. It's for an Outlaw by the name of Ray...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003759|I'll track him down myself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003758|So, you don't get the contract. Simple as that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003757|I don't have 1000 Elexit.|1000 = said as a thousand
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003756|Hey, you don't really think that I will just let you walk out of here, do you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003755|1000 Elexit. Just as it says on the contract.|1000 = said as one thousand
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003754|So... Are you going to pay me, or am I going to have to claim on the contract?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003753|I still want the shards for the contract, or for Ray's hide.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003752|Well, well, well. Here he is. Large as life and right in front of me. I guess this means we really do have ourselves a problem now, don't we?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003751|You know, I am sort of surprised about that myself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003750|Ray, you old son of a bitch. I was starting to think you weren't still alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003749|Now you want to get killed for that idiot?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003748|Give me the contract, or I'll kill you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003747|I hope he's worth it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003746|But, here you go. Here's the contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003745|Ray is worth that much to you? You obviously don't know that piece of shit that well.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003744|Okay. 1000 Elexit.|1000 = said as one thousand
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003743|It's not a bad deal from my perspective, so a thousand is the price and that's that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003742|I'm sorry. You want too much, this is a bad deal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003741|You will? Well, alright. But, I want the full reward.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003740|I'll pay you for the contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003739|You know about them do you? Well, yes I've got one and I'm going to claim the reward on it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003738|So, you've got one of these contracts?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003736|What will you do when you find him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003735|First tell me what the information's worth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003734|Ah, so you have found him. Well...if you've found him, that means I can. So, forget it, deal's off.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003732|Yeah? Come on then, then spit it out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003731|I know where Ray is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003730|But, don't think you can go lying to me and making up where he is. I'll know a lie if I hear it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003729|If it's a real lead and not troll crap then I'll pay you a decent reward for the information.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003728|What's it worth?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003727|He's called Ray. He's an Outlaw with a big mouth on him. Bit of a waster.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003726|What are you looking at, hey?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003725|Well, I guess that's my questions answered.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003724|Yeah? Well, if you do find Ray, can you let me know?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003723|I've met a lot of people. Maybe I've met him, maybe I haven't.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003722|No, I've not met anyone called Ray.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003721|You haven't met him anywhere out there have you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003720|Yes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003719|Well, I am looking for a guy and I wonder if you've seen him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003718|Hey. You've been out in the wilderness right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003717|I am watching you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003716|Mason's old hiding place is a wooden hut at the end of this path. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003715|If we can find him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003714|Is that a fact? Well, I know his weakness, I can probably pay him off with a few shards.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003713|I saw Mason. He's looking for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003712|We just have to go down the path here and follow the coast. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003711|He used his place as a bolt hole when he hit trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003710|Said he had a hideaway there.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003708|Listen. Something occurred to me.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003705|I'll ask around. See if it's true. If people know where he is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003704|You are, you say? Well, well, Have you seen him then?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003703|No, no, no, no. It doesn't matter to you. It's just business. Forget about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003702|It could be that we are looking for the same guy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003701|Tell me about him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003700|You are going to tell me how you know Ray.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003699|We used to be friends. We used to hang out in the same gang together. But, you know what that counts for? Nothing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003697|That amount of shards isn't funny. So, you and me might have a problem.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003696|Quick question. Do you know how much his ass is worth?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003695|Woof.|Dead pan
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003694|And who is this? Are you Ray's new watchdog, or something?|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003685|Pleasure doing business with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003684|Deal. Give me the contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003683|It can easily cost, say 200 shards.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003682|Forgetfulness can be expensive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003681|I'll buy that contract off you and you can forget about Ray.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003680|You had better disappear. Like, pfff, gone, or you'll have trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003679|And, if I do?|Weighing the player up
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003678|Do you have one of those contracts with you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003677|You don't know there's a contract out on him? I thought they were everywhere. I thought that was why you were looking for him.|Fishing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003676|Why is he worth so much?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003675|There is a whole crate of shards on his head.|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003671|Lucky you. Let me know if you meet the little piss streak. I want words with him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003670|Ray? No, I've not met him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003669|I am glad to see you too, Mason.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003668|Man, Ray. You are deep in the shit. Do you know that?|

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003666|His name is Ray. Whiney little shitbag. Reckons he's an Outlaw. Do you know him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003665|I am looking for a guy who was supposedly seen in the area recently.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003664|What do you want?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003663|Hey, hey you!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003662|I'm not asking for volunteers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003661|You fuck this up, we're all dead. Are you sure you want to do this?|Arguing, stressed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003660|Good luck, Ray. We're counting on you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003659|You stupid son of a bitch.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003658|Ray? Ray what the hell are you doing?!|Seeing Ray enter the glider and take off. Called while running
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003657|Then let's stop standing around and scrap those bastards!|Called to the troops, urgent

INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003651|Find Thorald. Discover his secrets.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003650|We are close to achieving our evolution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003649|You called for me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003648|The time is coming. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003647|Hey, watch the blade, I don't know what you're talking about!|Fast, scared
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003646|My equipment, my armor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003645|I don't know what you're talking about. What do you want from me?|Fast, scared
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003644|So we meet again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003643|That man. He's the one I saw on the mountain. The one who took my armor.|Too himself, growing angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003642|There can be only one consequence for failure.|Cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003641|You know our Directive.|Straight, no pleasure or anger.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003640|Jax! You've failed your mission.|Calling him, despite the Elex, he has some emotion about this being his brother. Then cuts to military
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003639|Wyatt is to meet anyone claiming to have completed the job outside the Fort at the planned meeting point.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003638|Wasn't there something about midnight and entrance gate on the head contract?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003637|No one else has been looking for you. Maybe Wyatt had the only set.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003636|A whole pile? You mean he might have contracted more Outlaws, not just Jackson's old crew?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003635|Well, we're finding them and without you I'd be dead already. Thanks for your help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003634|We still haven't found every copy of the contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003633|Well, his plan almost worked.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003632|I told some people at the Fort what had happened, I guess he must've paid people off to find out who I was. Then, he took out those contracts...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003631|It killed all but one of them, he escaped. I guess that was Walter. I guess that's why he's so pissed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003630|We could've shared it, but they wanted the whole thing. They opened up on me. I ran for it, but not before I'd booby-trapped the Behemoth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003629|There's a lot of good meat on those things. I was part way through butchering it when some Clerics arrived with the same idea.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003628|Nothing. I was out scavenging when I found a Fighting Behemoth out near the Fort. It had been injured and dragged itself away to die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003627|What did you do to end up with Walter putting a contract out on you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003626|Shit, of course. That all makes sense now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003625|He had a whole pile of contracts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003624|It looks like Walter was behind this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003623|So, another one out to get me. I'm not surprised, I mean of all the gang, Jackson didn't give a shit about anyone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003622|I have Jackson's copy of the contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003621|Jackson's camp should be nearby. This fight won't be easy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003620|Yeah, leave him out there and wait for him to find me, or find him first? Not much of a choice. This is going to be a real fight.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003619|Let's find Jackson.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003618|He's still got a copy of the contract for the hit, we need to take that out of circulation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003617|If Jackson's on the run, do we need to worry about him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003616|Last I heard, he was hiding in eastern Abessa near the dam.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003615|They're wanted men, so his gang is always on the move.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003614|Where is he?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003613|The guys he's running with now take anything from anyone, they murder, they... that's not how we used to be. Come on, we should find him before he finds me.|Saddened
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003612|Jackson's still doing what he's always done, leading a group of reavers. But, he's gone sour, I mean really bad.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003611|What about your old boss, Jackson? Do you have an idea where he is?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003610|He was a brave man when I knew him.|Saddened
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003609|He fought hard.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003608|Friend. Yeah, I mean that, friend.|Pleased
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003607|And, thanks again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003606|Aw, you know, Elexit turns up when you need it. No need to get stressed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003605|Where did you get those from?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003604|Yeah. Funny old world isn't it? But, what comes around. You earned me shards, so here, your turn.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003603|A guy you found and left for dead after looting his corpse.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003602|How about that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003601|You saved my neck. I mean...from some guy I met to the person who saved my life.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003600|That's all the copies of the contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003599|Come on, I'll take you there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003598|Where are these rapids?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003597|We thought it was raptorshit, I mean, an Outlaw with a place in Abessa? And one with a garden?!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003596|But, he was up there in Abessa looking for me, so we should check it out. See if he does have a cabin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003595|He was always raving about the rapids in Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003594|I've been thinking about Bomby|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003592|Now, maybe I'll have to kill all of them before they kill me. Unless we can find out who is behind this.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003591|Yeah, yeah, what would you expect from Outlaws? But, we were more than that, we were friends.|Imagining the player putting an argument
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003590|It is depressing though. That people I put my life on the line for seem to be conspiring to kill me.|Down
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003589|You say trouble, but my old crew wouldn't cost much to get onside, cheapskates.|Down
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003588|Someone's going to a lot of trouble over you, are you sure you can't think why?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003587|Why would anyone think I was this important? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003586|Mason had a copy of the contract on him. It seems all your old gang are after you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003585|What? Hey, what? No! Don't go killing my imaginary dog too.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003584|Can we get on and find Mason, he should be hanging around somewhere on the beach... fishing or something.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003583|You know that dog you've always wanted...?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003582|Wow, you really don't do daydreams do you. I mean I'm not even married and you've killed my wife!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003581|You know that would mean they would kill your wife as well.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003580|Look at this place, somedays I think we should all just take a wife and settle down instead of chasing after stupid pieces of paper.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003578|Good idea. If he's there, he might not stay too long.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003577|Okay. Let's go look for Mason.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003576|Maybe he's gone back there now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003575|I heard there have been sightings of Mason in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003574|What else can you remember about Jackson's old crew?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003573|Well at least you've managed to get that one back. It seems whoever I after me has the whole gang looking for me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003572|It seems you're famous all the way out to the coast of Tavar. He 'd got a contract on him. |Winding Ray up
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003571|Leo's nearby. Let's find him and see if he's got a copy of that contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003570|Yeah. They're the desperate Outlaw type in there. The only thing they'll help us with is...is...damn, you know I thought I had a one liner there, but it's gone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003569|You mean nobody in there is going to help us?|Unsurprised, stating the obvious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003568|Only thing is, he's likely to act big if his friends are there. And that might mean they support him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003567|There it is. Leo's hide out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003566|He's staying on the coast. I'll show you the way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003565|Out of them all, Mason, Bomby and Jackson will probably be the hardest to find.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003564|Okay. Let's find Leo.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003563|And, we can go to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003562|Tell me when you're ready.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003561|What I do know though is that Leo stayed in the desert.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003560|I lost track of the guys from Jackson's gang. I think they were looking for another crew to join. They really needed to make a profit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003559|Okay, the situation is this...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003558|Tell me about these contracts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003557|I know I'll regret this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003556|Hey, I sort of gathered you might be pissed at me. I thought knowing where you were might stop you doing something you'd regret.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003555|You were watching me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003554|Yeah, yeah. I already know where you store your things.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003553|I have a camp.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003552|Okay, then tell me where I should go and I am there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003551|Wow, that even sounds like optimism. And, that from an ice block.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003550|I guess it's the best deal I will get from you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003549|I know, I know, and I will pay you double what they're worth in return. As well as helping you. What do you say?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003548|You stole my armor and left me for dead, you already owe me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003547|And, I know I will only survive this with solid company.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003546|In return, you help me find Jackson's old boys and collect all the copies of this contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003545|I'll help you. I'll fight alongside you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003544|So, I am going to stick with you until my debt over the armor is paid off, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003543|Listen. I know I owe you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003542|Really, I don't. I'm a good guy. I don't have enemies, that's why I don't understand this. That's why those contracts have to disappear fast!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003541|It seems you have a talent for getting people pissed at you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003540|Yeah, I've seen your name on a contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003539|Well, someone does and I have to find out who it is before I get a bullet in my head.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003538|No, if Wyatt got the job to put this hit out there, then I know who gave him the contract.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003537|In the end, I left the group just before they all drifted away looking for better earnings.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003536|Wyatt must still be in contact with those guys.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003535|They were bad times and the earnings were slim.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003534|Wyatt and I were on the same crew at one time. We were part of Jackson's Gang.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003533|So, how did you think this will play out now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003532|And, coming here to find out might have got me killed over the wrong idea.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003531|If you knew all of this before then why did you drag me here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003530|I didn't know for sure. Still don't.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003528|W'? That could be Wyatt, but...|Putting the facts together
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003527|The contract taken out on you says to contact 'W' for payment..|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003526|What? Yeah. Honestly. I really don't know. Why would I go chasing Wyatt otherwise?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003525|Are you still trying to tell me you don't know who is trying to kill you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003524|Do you really think that's a coincidence?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003523|Hey, hey it was just a job, okay? I was only the middle man. You've got no argument with me! If I'm not going to get paid then this business is over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003522|W'? 'Walter'. We know who your boss is and he won't be paying you. Just be glad Elexit is all you've lost.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003521|What are you talking about?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003520|Your boss won't be paying you anymore.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003519|Unfortunate that you can't pay anyone the reward any more.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003518|You're going to regret stealing that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003517|And now I will get out of here if that's okay? So, have a good one.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003516|Oh, enough. They have been going faster than the offer of free beer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003515|You don't know who you are getting involved with here. You'd better get out of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003514|With a pile of shards in your pocket.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003513|You have a suspicious mind. And, even if that was true, what of it? I'm the errand boy here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003512|Don't bullshit me, I know why you're here. You are waiting to pay someone Elexit for killing Ray.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003511|If you don't believe in coincidence, you're going to spend life getting very upset about things you shouldn't worry about.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003510|Are you going to tell me you're here by pure chance?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003509|Why should I talk to either of you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003508|Man, no wonder you're with Ray. The two of you make a proper pair.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003507|Ray's contract is signed by “W.”. 'W' as in Wyatt.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003506|Tell us who has the rest of these contracts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003505|Alright, alright. Take it, for all the good it will do you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003504|Just one more.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003503|How many of these contracts do you have left?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003502|Can you see why I might say no to that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003501|You mean, I should tell you the name of a person who takes out contracts on someone who upsets them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003500|Who told you to distribute these?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003499|Have a good day.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003498|But good. I don't want any trouble with you. Say what you want and just get out, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003497|Pah, is that bum even paying you anything to come here and make a fool of yourself?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003496|Mh, you don't look like you're joking around, huh?|Stress on 'did' - to the player character
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003495|Hey! Don't fool around!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003494|They say you are distributing these contracts, and that there's quite a high sum set out on his head.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003493|That is charming. And is there a part where you tell me what that has to do with me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003492|I didn't come for the Elexit, but now that I think about it...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003491|Just tell me what you know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003490|Let's say I have an interest in making sure nothing happens to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003489|Are you here to collect? Or, just get information on the reward?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003488|Ah, that guy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003487|Ray. From Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003486|Who did you say?|Feigning ignorance
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003485|What do you know about a contract taken out on an Outlaw called Ray?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003484|Yeah? What do you want?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003483|Okay, but be careful.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003482|Then I will talk to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003481|That shitbag, Wyatt is over there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003479|If those guys recognized me we may have trouble. So, be careful.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003478|Now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003477|Alright, okay, that will work. Let's go.|Thinking it through
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003476|I can feel a target on my back even now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003475|Let's not fight. We have to do it quickly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003474|I have a better idea. I speak with Wyatt and you stay in the background.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003473|I want to find out who paid him. I want you there with me in the background.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003472|That assbag is the one distributing the contracts on me up there in the Fort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003471|There is a guy called Wyatt I need to find.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003470|What are you planning now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003469|Ah, come on. Don't fool around. Those guys don't take prisoners.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003468|You mean 'you' will have bounty hunters after you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003467|If we're unlucky, they will have reported me and we'll have the bounty hunters after us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003466|Hey, man. Not a minute too early. The guys up there've already seen me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003465|Just don't take too long, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003464|I am already gone. I'll wait on you at the entrance to the Fort. We are going to do good things together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003463|Get out of here before I change my mind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003462|Well, at least awhile after you've come down from Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003461|Hey, people can say what they want about you ice blocks, but there's a heart hidden somewhere under that cold skin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003460|All right. But, don't make me regret it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003459|And, I can't pay you back for that equipment if I'm dead. It's in your interest to help me out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003458|Hey, wow, losing the Elex has brought out your emotions. But, think. I can help you. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003457|So, you really think I'll forgive you and help out?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003456|Exactly. And for what? It's not like I've stolen anything big enough to get someone this pissed with me. Present company excepted.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003455|And, yet someone wants you dead.|Dead pan
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003454|I mean, I'm Ray. Happy Ray, Friendly Ray. 'The guy you want at your camp fire Ray'. There's not a crew I've worked didn't want me back.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003453|Yeah, I mean no, that's part of what I am trying to figure out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003452|And, you really don't know who put a price on your head?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003451|A full contract, with my name on it and I don't know who it is, or why they've done it. I mean, I'm Ray! Loveable Ray. Who wants to kill Ray?|Protesting
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003449|Steal? That was just that one time and I thought you were dead. Look, there's some guy put a price on my head.|Protesting
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003448|What is it you're planning to steal?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003447|There are some things there I have to sort out, but I'll have a lot of trouble trying to get in alone. It won't take long to get what I need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003446|You help me get in.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003445|And, when we get there?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003444|Come with me into the Fort, that's like the Outlaws HQ here in Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003443|Well, good. Let's assume I am buying this nonsense...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003442|You need someone with a flair for business, someone who can sniff trouble before you hit it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003441|I don't need you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003440|You haven't so far. You've got lucky. You might may be an expert in war, Commander, but trust me, out there, you're a beginner.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003439|You'll get cheated, betrayed and that's if no one figures out who you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003438|Lessons in pscycho-cology'? Just listen to yourself, man! You don't even talk like real people.|Not understanding the word
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003437|You think I need lessons in psychology?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003436|You're an Alb, a fighter, but you don't know the world outside of Xacor like I do. I know how people think.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003435|Seems we're both on the run, hey? Partners in crime? You help me, I help you.|Attempting to make a connection
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003434|Yeah. And finding you, finding your stuff gave me the funds to clear out before they caught up with me, so I came back here into the desert.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003433|These guys who are after you, are they the reason you left Edan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003432|You left me to die after stealing from me, why shouldn't I leave you to die?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003431|You see, I've got some people after me, I need some help dealing with them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003430|Yes, I got that, but you have to help me first.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003429|No. I'm saying we could help each other. You don't need the Albs, or anyone chasing you. And, I need to get these guys off my back.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003428|Are you threatening me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003427|And, surely that's how you want me to remember it? That you're dead. You don't want people to know you're alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003426|You were a dead man. You can't steal from a dead man.|Defensive, guilty
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003425|You have to understand, it's gone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003424|Sold it to who?|Cold, threatening
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003423|I don't have it. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003422|I sold it off.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003421|Did you steal from these people too?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003420|I'm here for my armor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003419|Stole? Stole?|Acting surprised at the acusation
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003418|I want my armor back. You're going to give it to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003417|Who would believe you even if you live long enough to be believed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003416|And, so will all the factions if they find out who you are. So, calm down and stop drawing attention to yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003414|Hey, hey, before you start threatening me remember who you are and where you are. You're an Alb, an Alb Commander. Your own people will want you executed...|Realising he has a defence
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003413|Give me my armor and equipment back and I won't kill you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003412|Honestly, I didn't think I was stealing, I thought it was salvage. I thought you were dead!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003411|Shit.... Shit! You're him. How did you survive?|Realising, scared
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003410|A drink won't pay for the equipment and armor you stole, you asshole.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003409|How about I throw you off the nearest cliff and take everything you have?!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003408|Just tell me where my armor is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003407|Or, the profit. Not the Albs, their Separatists, not the Clerics, or the Berserkers. The Fort is where the real power lies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003406|Or, the profit?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003405|None of the other Factions will give you the sort of freedom you can get here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003404|You'll find it profitable.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003401|What if I want to join the Outlaws?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003400|So, don't fuck up. Don't speak ill of his name and don't forget that profit is everything.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003399|Then we have a few things to clear up.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003398|So do your job and make yourself useful... Outlaw of Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003397|Such is the way of Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003396|Fuck up your duties and we'll have your insides on your outsides.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003395|But work, gain profit, and you will be rewarded.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003394|Word?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003393|You have my word.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003392|Do and you will see the consequences.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003391|There can be no talk against the Duke, or his family.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003390|You will have to deal with me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003389|If it comes to my ears that you are negotiating with Berserkers... or with the Clerics...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003388|From now on, you act in the name of the Duke. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003387|That is an honor. But I must warn you:|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003386|You have proven yourself worthy to become one of us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003385|Visitors, vagrants, travelers and enigmas - they are all part of my responsibility.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003384|But, then at least his work is black and white. There are Albs and there are Clerics, while I...must decide which category these Separatists belong in.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003383|It is Judicator Ulbricht who is overseeing the war against the Albs. Not a task that I envy him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003382|That is the task of the Clerics now. Personally, I oversee the defense of the Hort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003381|So, you think you are responsible for holding back the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003380|As you wish. But, don't take too long.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003379|No, I still need to think about this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003378|Do not waver. As long as good people join with us, like this one here, there is good reason to hope.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003377|Yes, we are few but our numbers will soon increase.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003376|He will master his new duties, firm in his faith in Calaan and with great courage.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003375|He was a wanderer without a home. He was an outcast and searching for purpose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003374|But his path is clear now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003373|Now, go and make us proud. Spread confidence and salvation. Cleric of Ignadon. Cleric of Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003372|Today we welcome a new member into our community.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003371|Calaan, whose wisdom guides us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003370|And we have done all of this in the service of Calaan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003369|From the day the Comet hit our planet, we have been the guardians of technology.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003368|We have preserved and developed the tools that will keep us alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003367|The Clerics have stood against all those who would see our world, our civilization swept away.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003366|Maybe, these Separatists want to join the Free People. Maybe they're just another threat.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003365|Now they must choose theirs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003364|I have chosen my destiny.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003363|Now all the Factions must decide.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003362|The Hybrid's era is gone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003361|To decide the future of Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003360|It is now my task to prepare for that day.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003359|Will that mean an end to all that is here? Or will it be a gateway to evolution?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003358|Are coming to claim their creation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003357|The creatures that made it, that reforged our world from out amongst the stars.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003356|The blood that has been spilled to gather Elex to feed his powers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003355|It has changed every living thing on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003354|There is power in Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003353|Who will listen to his warning?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003352|But, after all of the years of his secrecy...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003351|To make us understand the changes that Elex is making to our world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003350|The Hybrid spoke of his plan to prepare the world for what is to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003349|A civilization lost in fire and ash.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003348|Magalan, a world reshaped by the Comet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003347|My past is meaningless, it holds no fear. Your attempt to use it only proves that you cling to the irrelevant.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003346|Die now, or die at the hands of those that follow. Your death will be meaningless, only my survival matters now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003345|Your plans were wrong then, they are wrong now. You are not the superior being you think you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003344|My emotions don't cloud my mind. They have made me realize things about the world I could not have seen before.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003343|I did not come all this way to die at your hands. I came here to take back control of my world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003342|You should understand that despite my lack of Elex I have eliminated my emotions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003341|Your time is over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003340|I didn't come here to let you rule this world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003339|But...No. His emotions and self-doubt meant he needed another mage, that was his downfall. He is too emotional as well. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003338|But...No. His emotions and self-doubt meant he needed another mage, that was his downfall. He is too emotional, too |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003337|Thorald, the Pilgrim, was the closest to defeating me. His powers would be helpful to us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003336|Is there no one amongst the Free People who could join the chosen?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003335|My vision is the only one way to save Magalan, the chosen will evolve to serve those who follow. All Elex must serve my purpose, All people must serve me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003334|Even if this is true, why should I believe we can't fight these invaders like we fought you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003333|It seems you are the only one who knows the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003332|Your only interest is your own survival.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003331|You will always be an Alb. All you have accomplished must have proved to you that no individual can accomplish things alone. True strength lies in the collective consciousness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003330|But, it has made me their emissary. You think you fight to save our world, but it is me and me alone who can do that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003329|My destiny was set the day the Comet struck our planet. Elex transformed me. It was an accident of fate, no plan of those who follow.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003328|The Comet that destroyed Magalan's civilization did not arrive by chance. It was sent to begin the changes to our world, to prepare it for those who follow.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003327|The world must be changed before they arrive, Elex will see to that. But we must prepare people and gather the Elex that will make the changes that must come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003326|The world, as you know it, will not exist in a few years. All life that remains will be forced to obey those who come to us now. They will obey, or they will cease to exist.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003325|They can divert comets and send them across vast distances. Their power is well beyond our own.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003324|Can we stop them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003323|The further I evolve, the more I can hear their voices. First as whispers, now as minds I can commune with.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003322|Those who will inherit our world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003319|That is the truth I have guarded. And I have been preparing our world for this day.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003318|The Free People will not allow you to succeed, they won't stop until you are dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003317|My death is of no consequence to me, but to Magalan...If I die, so this world will die, for only I can ensure its survival.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003316|Soon. With the things I have learned I will open the way for the chosen. You will lead the way into the world that will come after this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003315|I understand more than you can imagine. I can control emotion, you are letting it consume you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003313|It is a shame the architect of the bomb in Tavar was killed. A few of those weapons and we could be rid of the Free People and the problems they cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003312|Hate, emotion and greed drives their conflict and it will be their end.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003311|Imagine what they could achieve if you worked with them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003310|They have no interest in peace, they crave only their personal victories.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003309|The Free People understand nothing but their own personal vengeances, that is why the Albs live without emotion. That is why the Albs have succeeded.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003308|Elex was sent here to change our planet in preparation for those who follow. Nothing can be allowed to stop that change.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003307|The Free People are using Elex in their technology, their World Hearts and their magic, they are blind to its true purpose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003306|Maybe, if we fight on the same side we can defeat these beings together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003305|Their beliefs have no meaning, there is only fact. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003304|Is your mind so clouded you can no longer see the truth? The desires of the Free People are meaningless. Will you die with them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003302|Why not work with the Free People to stop these invaders?.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003301|The Free People will never believe your story.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003299|The world refused to listen until it was too late. That day the Elex changed me. I was reborn, evolved. I failed to save us then. I will not fail again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003298|The Free People cannot be allowed to stand in our way. Their infighting had long stopped them from successfully interfering with our plans.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003297|I foresaw the day the Comet would strike our world. I was there when it hit. All my words, all my warnings all were ignored.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003296|You don't expect me to believe all of this?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003295|Now that Judicator Ulbricht is dead you must use your influence to stop the Clerics. If you value the future of all you have been, you will serve me and save our world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003294|You once followed my word without question. It is a loss to us all that my influence ended with your brother's botched attempt to kill you. But now, you know the truth and you can complete our vision together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003293|All the Elex on Magalan shall be required if we are to stand against the coming threat.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003292|But, your work is worse than futile. You think of yourself as a savior, but if we stand against these beings, we will all perish. Now, at least the chosen will survive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003291|You have accomplished much, Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003290|Who is coming?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003289|There is nothing we can do to stop this. We can only be ready for their arrival.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003288|What the Free People think is irrelevant. But, you Jax, you must understand the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003287|When will I reach the next step of evolution?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003286|If individuals aren't important then why do we need you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003285|If you really know the future, then tell me what will happen.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003284|My kind? I am not the person I was. I am no longer your slave.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003283|You don't understand anything about me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003282|Your arrival here is proof that you are closer to the next step in evolution than any of your kind, but there are things you are yet to understand.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003281|I came here for answers, not more empty promises.|Dismissive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003280|More emotion. Your personal quest is meaningless. If you think your actions now have consequence, you are mistaken.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003279|The same promise you have made to the Albs since you took control.|Dismissive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003278|You would know that true understanding is only possible through me. Join the chosen and you will know the meaning of our work.|Cold, logical
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003277|The chip improves efficiency. If the chip hadn't been damaged you would not be asking this question.|Cold, logical
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003276|If my past is irrelevant why did you put a chip in my head to control my thoughts?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003275|The past is irrelevant.  Only the future holds any importance.|Cold, logical
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003274|The Hybrid sees all, so did you order my death? Or, just allow it? Was it my past that condemned me?|Questioning why the Hybrid might have had him executed.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003273|You are speaking with emotion, not logic.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003272|If you wanted to see me, you shouldn't have allowed my execution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003271|You have changed in your time away.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003270|You have changed in your time away. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003269|You must have many questions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003268|Come to me. We have much to discuss.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003267|You are here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003266|So, you are here. I have been awaiting your arrival.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003265|I'll hand the raider over to you when you are ready.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003264|Here, the 5000 shards for the raider|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003263|Okay. Sad to lose her though.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003262|Here, the 2000 shards for the raider|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003261|Well, if that's the case then you will have to hand over some crates packed with shards to pay for my work.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003260|Deal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003259|So, let's say 2000 shards and we're in business.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003258|These raiders are hard to get hold of, but...you did get all the replacement parts, with my guidance. This was a joint effort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003257|What do I have to do to persuade you to give me the raider?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003256|And try not to get killed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003255|We'll all be here. Hoping not to die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003254|Go show the Hybrid. I hope you get the answers you need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003253|Good luck.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003252|I think the others are already waiting on you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003251|Ray...you crazy bastard...I guess he felt guilty for getting me into this mess. Well, Ray...you've opened the way to the Ice Palace, I guess it's time for me to go deeper into Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003250|Well, it looks like someone crazy asshat did your flying stunt for you. That guy must have owed you big time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003249|You are one crazy son of a bitch.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003248|This the only way in, so I will have to figure out how to escape when I'm there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003247|That's suicide. How will you get out in time?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003246|Attacking that generator from the air is the only way to take it out. I'll have to ram it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003245|I've just about had time to get this thing flying again. It's a complex machine!|Protesting
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003244|Then why didn't you tell me that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003243|Then why didn't you tell me what you were planning? If I had known I could have told you the weapons weren't|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003242|I've not had time to repair the weapon systems on top of everything else!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003241|You said you wanted to fly it!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003240|We said 'fully operational'.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003239|You never said anything about weapon systems.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003238|Why? What's the problem?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003237|Right. You could've said that earlier.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003236|No, I need the raider to take out a shield generator.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003235|Attack, right...So, you're not just using this for transport?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003234|I will start the attack on Xacor now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003233|Get that flier ready to go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003232|This will be useful..|Pleased
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003231|This could be useful...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003230|This could be useful.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003229|Tell Thorald I will be there when he starts the experiment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003228|You should help him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003227|That he can take away the fighting strength of the Albs with one act of magic?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003226|So, he thinks he's finally done it does he?|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003225|Thorald needs your help with this Elex experiment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003224|So, you remain a fanatic to the end? I hope your choice hasn't damned us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003223|And, for the hope of all Magalan, we must be victorious.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003222|So, we must take that fight to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003221|You said that we are fighting for the same cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003220|And, I can see no future for Magalan while that abomination still lives.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003219|But, we will stand against each other as enemies there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003218|I know you want to protect the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003217|It seems an assault on the Ice Palace is the only way to end this war.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003216|Caja is able enough when it comes to magic, but she's misinterpreted what she's seen.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003215|How Could Caja just stumble on something like this in the time she's had?|Dismissing the idea not asking a direct question
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003214|Couldn't that be what went wrong?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003213|She said that's what she felt. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003212|I've run experiments on Elex, studied it for years and I've seen nothing to indicate that what you're saying is true.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003211|What you're saying is impossible.|Dismissive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003210|That Elex is more than a substance, that it communicated with her.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003209|What are you talking about?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003208|Caja thought Elex could be alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003207|It isn't alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003206|And, Elex is a substance, not an entity.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003205|Resistance would imply purpose, consciousness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003204|Not probable, or not possible?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003203|But, that's not probable.|Uncertain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003202|The only other explanation is that Elex itself was resisting the transformation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003201|You don't seem certain.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003200|His intervention is the only thing that makes sense.|Uncertain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003199|What if Zardom wasn't responsible for your failure? What if something else stopped your transmutation?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003198|The Hybrid must be killed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003197|We will see each other again in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003196|We must take the fight to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003195|What will you do now that the experiment's failed?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003194|So, he'll want to keep an eye on things in the Ice Palace. He will be close to there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003192|Xacor. His ambition has always been to take command there. He seeks a chance to rule.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003190|Where do you think Zardom has taken Caja?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003189|He was interested in her. He asked me to find her. That can't be a coincidence.|Realising
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003188|He must be planning to use that power for himself in some way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003187|But, then killing her would also have stopped the transmutation, so why did he kidnap her?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003186|Zardom must've seen the same power in Caja that you did.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003185|Kidnapping her has stopped me making any further progress with my plans.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003184|What about Caja?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003183|Even if we can find Caja, it would take weeks to recalibrate everything before attempting that again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003182|If they are this intent on stopping us, the Hybrid must be close to achieving his plans.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003181|We must move to attack the Ice Palace as soon as we can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003180|I can't try again alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003179|We were close, but Zardom must've known what we were planning.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003178|We failed. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003177|So be it. Keep your distance. This could be dangerous for anybody close by.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003176|You should begin the experiment now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003175|Are you? Are you sure this will work?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003174|If it works in practice then all the Elex on Magalan should be transmuted.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003173|Are you sure you are ready for this?|To Caja
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003172|Everything is ready. We can begin immediately.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003171|You're not the only mage, Caja. I'm certain of my findings. 90 per cent certain. 60 or 70 per cent at worst. But, if we pull it off, who's to know we were ever worried?|Admonishing then lightening up
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003170|Caja will help with the experiment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003169|Well, bold times take bold decision. I'll have to trust her. But, she won't listen to a request from me. You must ask her to do it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003168|What other choice do you have?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003167|This isn't the time for impulsiveness.|Stating her weakness
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003166|The magic we'd be channeling, if she didn't follow orders...|Knowing she can do it, but concerned about her discipline
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003165|Caja has the ability, but as for the temperament...|Assessing her
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003164|Then ask Caja.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003163|But, I can't control that amount of magical energy on my own.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003162|The planning is complete.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003161|I will need a 'strong' mage to help me. Someone who truly understands the nature of Elex and Mana.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003160|How far advanced is your plan to transmute the Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003159|The Hybrid's power should rule. Xacor should subjugate the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003158|Perhaps I will finally get the answers I am seeking.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003155|Now I know the code to the Hybrid's chamber, I should use it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003154|Immortal, inaccessible... all-powerful... the pinnacle of evolution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003153|His name - Dr. Adam Charles Dawkins|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003152|What does he want for himself? Survival? Safety? A future for us? There is only one way to know. I must speak to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003151|Still driven by the need to survive. He began to see the future. He saw the future then, but what of now? Can the Hybrid truly see the future?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003150|Dr. Adam Charles Dawkins|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003149|But what was this man, who was it that became the Hybrid that rules Xacor today?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003148|Secured with a password that referred to the name its human form once took: Now I can reach him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003147|Saved from the fires, but changed by the Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003146|His hunger for it grew. His mind opened, he became more dependant on it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003145|So here he hid. Here he survived. But what did he become? Elex flooding his body.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003144|The government failed to listen to him. He had failed to save them. All he wanted to do was survive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003143|A chance to leave the planet, to avoid destruction, but the plan failed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003142|He tried to prepare a select group, those who would be welcomed to the Infinite Skies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003141|All that had possessed him while he was a man was the thought of surviving the disaster that was to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003140|A man become mutant.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003139|It must be true. Here he was, holed up and hidden in a device of his own making in order to protect himself from the impact.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003138|They say the Hybrid saw the day the Comet struck, that he survived.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003137|Infinite Skies. A corporation that worked on secret research in the Old World.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003136|An Old World complex, built to hide something from the outside world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003135|And here is the place Harley said he found reference to Infinite Skies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003134|This is about more than just you, you ego maniac.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003133|That means I can get to him. Then maybe I can find out what he really wants.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003132|If it worked, he could have told me to kill myself at any time, but the failed attempt to execute me must have damaged the chip instead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003129|The Hybrid planted a control chip in my head.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003128|I...I...I...Every time you make this personal, I get pissed at you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003127|If we can make it into the Ice Palace, then it is time to confront him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003126|Then you're going to try and get in?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003125|I have the code to the Hybrid's chamber.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003124|Perhaps. But there's only one way to find out and that means going there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003123|It could be a coincidence, but...weird, hey? Maybe you can find the answer there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003122|Yeah, that's the place. That's where I saw those words.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003121|Where I found the first replacement part for the raider?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003120|You mean the Old World ruins at the foot of the mountain?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003119|Yeah, I got it. There's an old industrial complex out to the southwest of Edan where I found some stuff that mentioned that. An old lab there.. But...nah, forget it. Why would that have anything to do with the Hybrid?|Remembering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003118|Infinite skies? Hey, that's something I've seen before, in a couple of places, but where.... where....?|Recognising them, trying to remember
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003117|All that I know is the code has something to do with the Hybrid's past and has something to do with stars, the universe, infinite skies... |Searching through what he remembers
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003116|Do you know where you can get it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003115|But, that means I need to get the code to access his chamber.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003114|If I am to get the answers I need then I have to find a way to get to the Hybrid in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003113|You've done some impressive stuff, so don't turn out to be a shit in the end, will you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003112|And, one more thing: Let's not pretend that I don't know who you really are, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003111|So, what are you planning?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003110|Everything that happens, that has happened for generations is because of the Hybrid. Only he can answer my questions, only he can end this war.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003109|But, I don't why, I don't know what he is planning for the Albs, or for Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003108|The Albs are led by the Hybrid. It is him they serve, it is him they pledge their lives to.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003107|So, this is more than just a family feud....So, what's the problem?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003106|But, this is far from over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003105|My brother won't trouble us any more.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003104|Well, it's not for me to tell you what to do, but I would take care of that as soon as you can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003103|So, he's still alive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003102|Kallax is still a threat to us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003100|I mean that guy's a maniac, right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003099|Then we should be happy you're not in pieces.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003098|Ah... really? And, you beat him, right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003097|I met with my brother Kallax, the Elexetor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003096|Right. Don't get killed. I mean that. And, not just because you dying would land the rest of us in the shit. I've, you know, got used to having you around.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003095|I don't know. We will see.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003094|Right. You think you're strong enough for that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003093|I will have to confront my brother Kallax sooner, or later. The Elexetors must fall.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003092|So, is this just some big family bust up? Is there any chance you're going to turn round and buddy up again? I'm only asking because, you know, this affects the fate of the world and shit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003091|So?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003090|They are saying you're fighting your brother?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003089|One question.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003088|That is unfortunate. Only Albs will benefit from Kallax still drawing breath.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003087|No. He still lives.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003086|Is Kallax dead?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003085|Truth, it always brings its own burden.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003084|No. But, I now understand my brother's true nature.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003083|And? Did you find what you are looking for?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003082|I met with Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003081|We have to be one step ahead of them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003080|Come back when that's taken care of. I will make sure that the raider is prepared.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003079|I still have to find the shards to buy your half of the raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003078|You still need your control jet for the raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003077|I need that before I attempt to enter the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003076|I still need to learn the access code for the Hybrid's chamber.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003075|Thorald, the Pilgrim is yet to complete his Elex experiment. That must be done before we attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003074|I still have to figure out what the Separatists will do when we march into Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003073|That way I can open a path to get to the Ice Palace without the Alb forces in that area killing me before I've managed to get close.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003072|I have to take care of the Alb Commanders in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003071|You just tell me when you're good to go and I'll have it ready.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003070|I've completed everything. I'm just waiting for you to finish the raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003069|Just make sure you get it done before the whole damn Alb army shows up here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003068|Well, it sounds like there is still something to do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003067|All right, so this is where we are up to.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003066|Is there a timescale coming at any point?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003065|There are a few things to take care of first.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003064|So, when does the raider have to be ready?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003063|But, don't forget to pay me first, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003062|I was afraid that you would say something like that.|Annoyed, but resigned.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003061|Five thousand...? Right.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003060|So, it'll have to be 5000 shards.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003059|Ah, so that's how it is? Then this isn't anything but a job to you, huh?|Annoyed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003058|You'll get the raider when I'm ready.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003057|Don't forget I put this pile of shit back together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003056|Hey, watch your tone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003055|Unless you want me to cut you in half, get the damn thing done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003054|What do I have to pay to buy your half?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003053|This raider is the only chance to stop the Alb attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003052|I'll get to repairing this right away.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003050|Don't forget half of that crate is mine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003049|Well, I almost have the thing done, but...you want to take it to Xacor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003048|I need that raider ready. The Albs are gathering strength to attack the Free Lands. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003047|So, not easy to get.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003046|Well, that's a good piece of work.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003045|Here, I got the replacement control jet for the raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003044|That means looking near the Ice Palace in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003043|So, I guess the only place I can think of would be an Alb maintenance center.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003042|Well, only the Albs build this kind of raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003041|How do we get a new control jet?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003040|If we don't fix that, the only thing you'll be flying is circles.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003039|One of the control jets must have taken a hit when it came down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003038|What else do you need to get the raider ready?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003037|Get your raider ready. We will need it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003036|And, it has something to do with the Old World.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003035|Kallax's reaction proves I'm on the right track.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003034|So, the code is something to do with the Hybrid's past. And the vision that Kallax saw.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003033|Perhaps it might mean something to Harley, he knows a lot about Old World installations.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003032|You are my brother, that must count for something.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003031|Who I was has no impact on my decisions today. Only the Hybrid and the future count.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003030|You must remember your past. It explains who you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003029|I will end this here and now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003028|You had better stay away from it... Brother.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003027|Be warned, come to the Ice Palace and it will be your death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003026|Neither you, or the Hybrid are infallible. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003025|No, I cannot allow that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003024|Then let me come with you, we can face him together.|Struggling, beginning to doubt
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003023|No, no...the Hybrid must still have plans for you, plans that I am yet to understand.|In denial
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003022|Then recognize the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003021|I cannot believe you survived.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003020|When the Hybrid is defeated by an outcast then you will see his flaws. I will ensure that happens.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003019|We can build a future together instead of killing hundreds at the word of the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003016|Your opinion has become clouded by emotion. You no longer see the purity of the Hybrid's vision.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003015|The future can be decided by anyone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003014|The future is for the Hybrid to know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003013|So he says, but what proof is there? And what is it he sees in the future?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003012|His understanding of evolution and his ability to see the future are the only ways that we can save Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003010|The Hybrid is the only way we can survive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003009|Something is wrong with the Hybrid. Committing yourself to him will only destroy you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003008|Emotions are a waste of energy, they cloud perception.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003007|Are you trying to provoke an emotional reaction?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003005|I serve the Directive. The Law demands the death of those who learn it illegally.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003004|Come on, Kallax, you know there is more to this. I know you wanted answers then. You must still want them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003003|You had your chance, but you let it pass.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003002|Listening to you any longer is a waste of time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003001|You have come to me with the emotion and twisted logic of the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00003000|But, they too are irrelevant. We benefitted from the fact we were taken from the Berserkers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002999|You were too young to remember, but I have always remembered the faces of my real parents.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002998|I have always known.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002997|How long have you known that we are the children of Berserkers?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002996|The Hybrid must achieve supremacy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002995|The past is irrelevant, all that counts is the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002994|We should know what makes him who he is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002993|Our world is in the hands of the Hybrid. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002992|You are allowing your own emotions to cloud your thinking.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002991|Doesn't that sound emotional? Why would he stick with something like that? It has to mean something.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002990|It would be efficient to change it. But, instead, the code remains the same. And it is rumored to link to his past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002989|It could be anything, it would be logical for it to be random.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002988|You expect me to believe that you have never wondered about the code?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002987|The past is irrelevant.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002986|But, all I know of his past is that the Albs found him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002984|So, I'm right. It is something to do with his past, with what you saw?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002983|You said Tarek talked about the Old World, is that a clue?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002982|The universe, skies stretching to infinity.' Does that relate to the code?|Remembering what Kallax said in the vision
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002981|The past is irrelevant, all that counts is the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002980|So, why does the Hybrid hide his? What is it about his past that he wants to stay hidden? You saw his past, when you had an audience with him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002979|What I saw is irrelevant.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002978|That he showed our leaders the future and took control of our people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002977|I know that the code is something to do with the the Hybrid's past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002976|Only Elexetors can be told that. You are no Elexetor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002975|I must speak to the Hybrid directly. What is the code to his chamber?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002974|How can I have my free will?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002973|Tell me, Jax, do you never see images you can't explain? Visions?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002972|He sees the future, the plans of the Free People, all of Magalan and some of those visions will have leaked into your mind through the chip.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002971|Some of those will be memories, others are thoughts that spring from your connection to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002970|Convenient, that your proof has been destroyed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002969|That is the only explanation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002968|Your chip must have been damaged, when I attempted to execute you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002967|Because you got lucky.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002966|If I have a chip then why hasn't the Hybrid ordered me back to Xacor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002965|You had been chosen to evolve to the next level. The Hybrid had even had you implanted with a chip ready to communicate with you, so he could guide your thoughts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002964|We have been selected to serve his future, to ensure that future comes to pass.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002963|They and others he sees the potential in.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002962|All Albs the Hybrid sees as having Elexetor potential have a Biocore chip implanted to maximize their efficiency. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002960|What did you mean 'appoint me to the chosen'?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002959|Is that why you really came here, Jax? Are you ready to die?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002958|The Directive is clear. Failure of a mission is punishable by execution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002957|Murder? You failed your mission.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002956|Which of those drove your attempt to murder me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002955|That sounds like emotion to me, Kallax. Fear, anger, confusion.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002954|I will not let you spread the story further. I will keep my honor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002953|Wardek should have kept our secret.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002952|So... You know about our past?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002951|There you stand in the open, ready to be picked off.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002950|I sent you one message and you came running?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002949|And what brought you here, Kallax?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002948|How vulnerable your feelings have made you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002947|Where is the tactical skill that had the Hybrid ready to appoint you one of the chosen?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002946|Show yourself so we can end this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002945|I know you are here, Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002944|Almost like I had been here before...|This is the village he was born in. So this should be a hint. Once he's found out that he's from Edan, there will be cutscene from the village explaining this.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002943|I can smell...there's something about this place. |Memory stirred by scent
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002942|Why would Wardek hide that from us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002941|Kallax and I weren't born in Xacor. We came from Edan. We were born Berserkers...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002940|So, that is what Wardek kept secret all these years.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002938|He named me Jax. And the other boy... Kallax!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002936|Then one of the attackers found us... and took us with them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002935|It was just me... and the other boy... |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002934|Everyone else was gone... all that remained were the lifeless bodies in the surf.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002933|Another boy hiding near me... just as afraid as I was.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002932|The town on fire. Screaming.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002931|People ran in panic. They ran... They were cut down...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002930|With their weapons of light and fire.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002929|It was raining... They came out of the darkness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002927|This path... This beach... |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002926|This was my home.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002925|I lived here... with my... parents?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002924|I was still a child... a young child.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002923|It was a long time ago, but I was here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002922|I have been here before.|The memories beginning to break through
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002921|This place. There is something familiar about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002920|So, this is the place Wardek wanted me to see.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002919|There is one place Kallax will not dare to take anyone from Xacor. You will know it when you see it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002917|Yes. But, time is pressing. You must act fast.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002916|Maybe then we wouldn't be here today, we'd be in the halls of the Ice Palace ascending to where you belong.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002915|But, I should have told the truth that a long time ago.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002914|I don't regret making you both into great men. I see the sons I created and they are Albs above Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002913|What life are you talking about? I saved you from death when the Albs destroyed your village.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002912|You destroyed our lives!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002911|What would you be? A fisherman? A vagrant in the forests? A wanderer amongst the rat holes of Edan?|Sneering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002910|Your parents would be dead anyway. Your lives would have been short, desperate, futile.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002909|You both have me to thank for lives of greatness.|Boastful
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002908|Threaten to reveal the truth and Kallax will come to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002907|He wants to hold on to power and fears that if the truth of his birth became known then he would lose that power.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002906|This truth is what you can use to lure Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002905|And how can your plans succeed now? There must be a way for us to achieve the greatness you want.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002904|You plans didn't include my exile and execution did they? Or Kallax's attempts to kill me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002903|Your plans?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002902|Yes. All the plans I had, shattered.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002901|We were. Then someone set me up. Now, your bastard children are trying to kill each other.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002900|My legacy was almost complete. You were poised to rule.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002899|And, I was successful. Look at what you and Kallax achieved. You rose to the very top in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002898|But, I couldn't have children. So, I did what Albs do. I took what I wanted.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002897|I wanted heirs. I had achieved much, but I wanted to found a dynasty of the most powerful Albs to follow in my footsteps.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002896|What I don't understand is why.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002895|Do I understand that you killed our parents and carried us off to the Ice Palace as your children?|Rhetorical question, he does understand that this happened.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002894|That Kallax and I were born Berserkers and not Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002893|Then do you understand?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002892|I have been to the fishing village in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002891|You must be able to tell me more than that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002890|I could tell you, but you may not believe me. You have to see it yourself to understand. I will speak to you when you returned.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002889|Tell me this secret.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002888|Losing his rank as Elexetor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002887|What is it he fears?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002886|Kallax has known for some time, and I think he fears the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002885|Something important happened in the past that I have yet to tell you.|Hesitant, revealing a difficult secret
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002884|There is a small fishing village on an island to the south of Edan. It is now long abandoned. You should go there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002883|That is where you will find the answers you are seeking.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002882|If you want to help him then help me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002881|Then give me a suggestion, father.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002880|It is better than you fighting his combat mechs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002879|Lure Kallax? Are you serious?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002878|That may be so, but be cautious. You know who you are dealing with.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002877|I expect he will go there straight away.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002876|I will send Kallax a message through my adjutor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002875|Then you should act now, before he decides to attack you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002874|It's good that I now know where and how I can challenge Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002869|No. That's a question you'll have to answer yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002868|Any suggestions for where I can lure him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002867|Then you'll need to lure him there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002866|You will have to find a place where the combat mechs won't go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002865|Zardom's old hiding place for instance.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002864|And how do I do that without walking into another trap?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002863|There must be another way to reach him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002862|I would have done, but the combat mechs you failed to warn me about had other ideas.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002861|Then you need to speak to Kallax yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002860|But, I don't remember even having access to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002858|That you were directly under the Hybrid's control. Working together as a group to do the Hybrid's will.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002857|What does that mean?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002856|Kallax told me I was to become an Elexetor. One of the chosen.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002855|Nasty and I will handle it on our own. Nobody will get by us to threaten the Hort.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002854|Well, if he has a plan that is supposed to benefit us I haven't seen a sign of it. That thing only  wants power.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002853|The Elexetors say that the Hybrid has a greater plan for all of us.|There are two sides to this
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002852|His powers do have the potential to help instead of destroy.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002851|If we don't gain the knowledge, we could pay the price for it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002850|We can hope the Mana will heal him as it is healing Magalan. Maybe we could force him onto a different path, but the safety of the planet must come first. Even if that means killing him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002849|I agree. While there is a chance we could stop the fighting and keep his knowledge. We would be risking all of Magalan to try.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002847|Whatever his plan is, it can't be worth the damage he's caused.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002846|For all his knowledge and power, he must answer for what he has done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002845|Killing the Hybrid is the only way to save Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002844|We should work with the Hybrid. His powers can benefit us all.|Persuasive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002843|If you do want to help all of the Free People then we should make the Hybrid work for us. If the Mana changes him we can use his powers to achieve our goals.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002842|The technology he has created can be used to benefit everyone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002841|Before we act, we should find out what the Hybrid knows.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002840|That he has the power to see the future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002839|That he knows the nature of Elex and why it came to our world. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002838|And, the cost to the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002837|But, the Hybrid has his reasons and it is our duty to obey him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002836|I understand the consequences.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002835|After everything we've fought for? Don't you see  the Hybrid only wants to enslave us? He has no interest in what we want.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002834|We must bow to his wisdom. He must remain in control.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002833|The constant wars between the Free People show me that the Hybrid offers the best chance for the people of Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002832|The final battle will be in Xacor. Then will we see who we all really are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002831|That thing hasn't hesitated to order the deaths of hundreds, thousands. There is a chance that we can convert it, change it with Mana, but change him, or kill him he must be stopped.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002830|You think killing should be an easy decision?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002829|If it doesn't work, the Mana will poison him. Is that a problem?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002828|We can try and change him with Mana.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002827|My raider being shot down, the Albs being nearby to carry out my execution, the chances of those things happening without being planned...?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002826|I share those suspicions, but I have yet to find any proof.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002825|I can't promise you that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002824|The Hybrid has made him blind to all other things. You must help set your brother free from the Hybrid's control.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002823|I am sure if your brother is involved it is only as an instrument, he must be being used by other people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002822|If Zardom is behind this then he had help. But, why would another Alb communicate with an exile?|Dismissing this, to protect himself
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002821|Then someone at the Ice Palace must have got that information to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002820|No, no, Zardom was already in exile when you received your orders from the Hybrid. |Considering this
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002819|Well, if that is true I don't know how he knew that information.|Considering this
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002818|And he knew the purpose of my mission.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002817|Zardom knew I was flying to Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002816|I know Zardom wanted my raider shot down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002815|You said we could change the Hybrid instead of killing him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002814|No one as ambitious as Kallax is without fault.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002813|Then look into his past. Speak to your father, perhaps he could tell you something that would help?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002812|No. Kallax is untouchable, he's practically worshipped. Otherwise, he would not have become an Elexetor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002811|The trust of the Hybrid is not earned easily. People know that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002810|Is there any way that you can discredit him? Get his own people to reject him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002809|Then you must choose a place yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002808|Why would he come there? Kallax is not one to give up an advantage in a fight alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002807|Maybe there you will get a chance to meet Kallax alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002806|The last time I tried to confront Kallax he didn't come alone. There were Albs patrolling the area where we were to meet. I need to get him alone.|This is a line following 53/7 if you've not met Kallax 'again'
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002805|Are you ready?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002804|It took one shot from our ballista to cripple the generator and that brought the shield down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002803|Your raider cannon has a lot more power than a ballista. So, if you hit the generator's ventilation port at full power, it will blow and the Ice Palace will lose its defense.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002802|All we had to do was target the ventilation port.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002801|Then you need to find an Elexetor and get the code out of him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002800|Anyone below that rank can't get enter the chamber unless the Hybrid calls them personally.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002799|But what? The Elexetors are the only ones with access to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002798|Don't you think I know that. But, none of my prisoners have known the code, or would give it up. All I have discovered is that it has something to do with the Hybrid's past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002797|To reach the Hybrid we will need the code to his chamber.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002796|Heal him. If we can bring him into contact with a Seedling it will transmute the Elex within him, changing his nature. We can heal him as we heal the planet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002795|We crippled a similar generator when we attacked the Converter here in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002794|How are we going to destroy the barrier generators?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002793|The same as it took to trust you. I want to see them start shooting at Albs. Actions speak more than words. Actions earn trust.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002792|What will make you trust the Separatists?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002791|With them dead, the soldiers won't stop us getting into the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002790|If we kill the Alb Commanders in charge of the defenses around the Ice Palace. The resistance should crumble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002789|We will have to target their commanders instead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002788|If they still have their Elex, we can't fight the Alb army.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002787|And, what if your plan to transmute all their Elex stocks doesn't work?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002786|Now, we need to take out what they have stockpiled.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002785|One raider won't stop an army.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002784|Your raider is perfect for that task. That's why we need it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002783|With the Converters gone, we've cut off their new supplies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002782|The Alb's biggest weak point is Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002781|Your plan is a frontal attack?|Doubting his plan.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002780|All we need to do is take out the barrier generators and we will open our way in.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002779|We've scouted the Ice Palace and now is the time to strike. The Albs have moved their forces. They trust too much in those energy barriers of theirs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002778|We need to take out those positions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002777|Or, if they will attack us as we move against Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002776|What I need to know first, is whether the Separatists will help us with this attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002775|That will open the way for a direct assault.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002774|The Albs have moved the bulk of their forces to the border of Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002773|He was a great man whose faith gave strength to us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002772|Whatever path lies ahead, I can only hope that Calaan gives me the wisdom and strength I will need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002771|His death leaves me as the last Judicator of Ignadon. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002770|Judicator Ulbricht has passed into the world beyond.|Solemn, speaking to the player
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002769|This nonsense has to end, he was your brother in arms, he is your brother by blood.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002768|Or, Kallax used you to set a trap for me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002767|Then either you lied.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002766|From Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002765|Where did you get that information in the first place?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002764|I told you what I knew of him, Kallax must have changed his plans.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002763|You told me Kallax was traveling alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002762|But, I was ambushed by several units of Alb soldiers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002761|Kallax lured me into a trap.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002760|So, Kallax set a trap for me. And Wardek walked me into it. He has some explaining to do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002759|Do you think you can anger me? I don't need anger, brother. The Directive, tells me you must die. What is dead should stay dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002758|Evolve into what? The Albs existed before the Hybrid, now we serve him. Now we bow to him. He has taken the place of Calaan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002757|From the ashes came the Clerics. Believers in Calaan. From Calaan came the Albs, believers in the future. From Elex came the Hybrid, seer of all things. Together we serve no god. We bow to no person. Together we shall evolve.|Rapid, repeating The Alb Creed.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002756|But even now as an Elexetor, what does the Hybrid tell you, Kallax? What do you know of the truth?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002755|You take the promises of the future and serve without question.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002754|So we've been told. But, what other lies have we yet to uncover?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002753|Powerful. Superior. They opened the door to our evolution. Our past is irrelevant.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002752|Wardek hid the truth. We were born Free People. Elex, the Hybrid, our father - they decided what we would become.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002751|And yet here I stand. You failed the Directive, Kallax. Perhaps we aren't perfect after all.|Referring to the failed execution
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002750|Your execution should have saved me from that .|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002749|Now, all I have is shame. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002748|The bond of blood with you, with father, once gave me honor. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002747|You appeal to me with emotion?|Cold dismissal
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002746|My brother.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002745|Why did you come here, Jax? What did you expect to find?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002744|Yet now even the fact you still breathe stands against the Directive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002743|I doubted what I was told, that you were failing the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002741|Even if there is someone behind this, I think you will learn his name on the day you stride up the great ramp to the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002740|I don't know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002739|So, who do you think is behind this?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002738|Zardom was always set on becoming First Elexetor. If he'd thought you were an impediment to that, he would have no hesitation in having you killed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002737|Now that he has left the Ice Palace he would have no reason to do that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002736|It's obvious he's planning something, could his plans involve killing me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002735|But, now he is here, out of Xacor, who knows what his plans are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002734|I know he was behind the attack on my raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002733|What about Zardom?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002732|These days he is merely a vassal to the Hybrid, I don't think he posses the ability to think as freely as this. I don't think he would do this without orders from the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002731|He has the power and the intellect to plan something like this. But, he is no longer himself. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002730|What about the First Elexetor, Tarek?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002729|You were under his control and offered no threat. Besides, if he wanted you dead he could have had you shot without the need for this intricate plan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002728|The Hybrid needed you and your skills to achieve his aims. While your free will may have made you stand out....Your will is nothing to the Hybrid's.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002727|What about the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002725|I say we need to find another way. One that does not lead to our ruin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002724|And soon, Tarek will dedicate all our people, the whole of the fighting strength of Xacor to an invasion of the lands of the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002723|All this death for one purpose, greater power to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002722|If that is your fate. But, you think clearly and independently now, Jax. You can decide your own destiny.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002721|And if he comes for me in the meantime, I will fight him rather than die myself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002720|He is a slave like Tarek. If you could free him from the Hybrid's will, then you could both be reconciled.|Appealing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002719|There must be a way to free him from the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002718|It is far too late for us to be reconciled.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002717|I would rather you both joined together, the death of either of you weakens us all.|Appealing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002716|That is why he is travelling alone.|This is a lie, he is trying to set the player up
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002715|Not if I get to him first.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002714|Have no doubt, he will strike as soon as he knows where you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002713|He is currently in the mountains of Abessa on the border of Xacor awaiting for information on your whereabouts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002712|He would only have carried out the execution if he had orders to do so.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002711|But, who ordered your death, who coordinated it? That I don't know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002709|You questioned it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002708|I don't believe that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002707|What about my brother, Kallax?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002706|The only cause I can think of is your free will. All other Albs took the Hybrid's favor as an honor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002705|I suspect that my failure and execution was planned by someone at the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002704|But, the questions are why? And who?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002703|He wants to finish what he started and prove his loyalty. After all, technically he failed in his mission to execute you. He will want to remedy that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002702|Your brother knows you are still alive... He is looking for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002701|And now look at you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002700|Today you are an outcast.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002699|No one could equal you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002698|Strong, intelligent, iron willed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002697|You and your brother were the strongest warriors at the Ice Palace's command.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002696|Do you think the Hybrid will talk to us? To him, we have no more free will than the mutants he commands.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002695|Then we should ask the Hybrid what he will become. We should know what we are choosing between.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002694|Where is Kallax now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002693|I will not sacrifice my son for the ideals of that machine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002691|No, my loyalty ended on the day of your execution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002690|With all the sacrifices we've made, with all the blood he wants spilled, has he told us what he will achieve if he attains that? How do we know what he will become?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002689|If the Hybrid's evolution is not yet complete, shouldn't we ensure he reaches his final form?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002688|The Hybrid tells us nothing of this future he sees, he is obsessed with his own evolution and that is only attainable through the consumption of ever greater quantities of Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002687|But, to achieve that, I now know that the Hybrid must be removed from the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002686|I still believe in serving the Albs of Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002685|No Alb, no Free Person will be allowed to stand in his way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002684|A lot has changed at the Ice Palace since the coming of the Hybrid and the pace of that change is only accelerating.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002683|All those were key to the Alb people and all have been dominated by the Hybrid's demand for Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002682|What happened to our search for knowledge? What about our evolution? What about researching the nature of Elex?|stress on 'our'
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002681|You served the Directive to obtain all Elex for the Hybrid, what changed your mind?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002680|The Hybrid and his new Directive dominate our people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002679|Tarek is a puppet. He has given his will to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002678|Why is Tarek such a danger?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002677|What is it he's doing that threatens the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002676|His blind obedience of the Hybrid endangers all our people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002675|I hope that I can still make a difference from here, I can help to bring a halt to Tarek's plans.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002674|I had no other choice. I tried to stop Tarek in Xacor, but he realized my plans. He would have killed me if I had stayed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002673|What are you doing here with the Separatists?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002672|We have to stop him, or our people will perish.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002671|He will make his move and he will succeed in conquering the lands of the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002670|That will change soon. The First Elexetor, Tarek, is assembling his troops before the gates of the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002669|We are told we are superior, but the Albs have failed to crush them, or their spirit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002668|That the Free People are capable of resisting the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002667|Tell me, what do you make of the world you have discovered since leaving Xacor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002666|There is more to the changes than just the physical. It is how you mind copes with the rejection of all that you have known. All you have been in life.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002665|I was unconscious during the worst of it. My body was already drained of Elex when I awoke.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002664|You must have experienced the problems of Elex withdrawal yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002663|I am trying, but it is difficult.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002662|So, you left Xacor. Have you stopped taking Elex too?|Wary, suspicious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002661|I hadn't dared to hope...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002660|Jax. So, it is true. You are alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002659|Father...?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002658|Listen to your inner voice, my son. Know your strength.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002657|There are still Albs holding positions out there. Go back and take care of them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002656|You'll have to find the Alb Commander and take his key card if you want in.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002655|We're not inside the Converter yet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002654|Is that enough of a challenge for you, Nasty? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002653|I can't think of any other solution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002652|But, you must hurry, we need to shut this place down before the Albs counter attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002651|Then we will need to find the Separatists. They should know how this works. And helping us will be their chance to prove that they have renounced the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002650|I'm not a technician. I have no idea how to do that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002649|Then our forces will hold here and cover you while you get inside and shut the Converter down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002648|I have the keycard.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002647|Find him and get that keycard.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002646|The Alb Commander must have it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002645|We will need a keycard to get inside.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002644|And, that means finding a way inside.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002643|We're through their defenses, but we have to shut the Converter down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002642|Is that all you've got?! Why's anyone afraid of the Albs?!|Called out to the enemy
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002641|If you hadn't killed the Albs, I'd believe this was some sort of a trap. And, you'd be dead right now. You really want to do this? You really think you can get into the Ice Palace?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002640|Okay, I'm in, asshole, I'm in.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002639|Yeah. Now your plans are starting to sound like my plans.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002638|I'm serious that I'll help you get into the Ice Palace. I have business there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002637|You're serious, you want to put an end to your own people?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002636|An Alb...hah, and I thought I'd met every type of lying doublecrosser ever.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002635|If I'm serious? Fuck you, Alb, I'm not the one who's been killing Free People! Well, I've killed a few who deserved it. Whereas you! You'd better not try and doublecross me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002634|I'm you're only way in. If you're serious about fighting for the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002633|Shit, I'll kill more Albs. And, I'll kill you if you're trying to double cross me.|Suspicious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002632|I can get us in. If you're prepared to kill more Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002631|I was Commander Jax. Now, I'm fighting alongside the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002630|Jax? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. How could I not recognize you, you ass hole.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002629|How the fuck can you know your way round the inside? No one has been in there and...oh, you fucker, you total double speaking fucker. You're an Alb?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002628|We have to go there at some point if we're going to finish this war. I can get us in there. I know my way around it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002627|The Ice Palace? Are you serious?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002626|Attacking the Ice Palace, is that enough of a challenge for you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002625|I'm only in this for the shards and the glory. Not to follow you round like a tame Jackal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002624|Then you'd better give me a challenge.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002623|You're not giving me orders.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002622|I thought I was giving the orders here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002621|Yeah. That and I need yours. Come with me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002620|You think I need your help?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002619|We fight well together. You should come with me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002618|Hah, we showed them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002617|And, I thought they'd make a fight of it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002616|They're dead. The battle is won.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002615|You need to take care of the rest of those Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002614|There are still more Albs out there. Take them out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002613|I will hold the position here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002612|Make sure we killed all of them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002611|I think we're through.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002610|Let's finish this!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002609|As long as it involves killing Albs. Let's send them to hell.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002608|Advance!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002607|Then let's get on with this. And, stay close.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002606|That's just the start, we have to go on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002605|This isn't about revenge, we have to put that Converter out of action.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002604|Let's finish this!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002603|Damn the Converter, let's make them pay!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002602|We have to get to the Converter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002601|Well, that was more of a challenge!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002600|Was that it? I thought the fight would be harder than that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002599|So move your ass and - attack!|Called order at the end of the line
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002598|If you're ready, I'm ready.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002597|Give the order to attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002596|Are we starting this fight, or not?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002595|Come on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002594|Go to your commander, soldier. We have to win this battle.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002593|Do not falter, do not give way, warriors of Ignadon. Go forward for Calaan. Go forward for Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002592|Now, go to your commander. The battle will begin as soon as Nasty gives the signal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002591|Then so be it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002590|The risk of losing the highest Judicator is just too great. Stay here and fight with us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002589|If Reinhold falls then so does the Hort and our plan, we should reinforce him. Keep them busy until we are there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002588|What are your thoughts?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002587|Committing to either course leaves the Hort vulnerable to an attack and if we lose the Hort, we lose everything. It is a gamble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002586|But, your force is also in need of reinforcement and it is on you that the fate of the whole enterprise depends.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002585|If I go with Reinhold, it will strengthen our force where the enemy is strongest.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002584|The question is where I should commit myself and my forces?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002583|Nasty will lead her group through the Alb positions between us and the Converter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002582|Reinhold's forces will advance directly on the Converter, attacking the main Alb force from the front and pinning them in that position.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002581|So. It has come to this day. Cleric against Alb and the future of Magalan hanging in the balance.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002580|Wait until after the battle!|In combat
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002579|You ask her, nothing is free. No one is free. There is only profit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002578|Time in the desert leading troops has taught her the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002577|She used to be an idealist.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002576|You sound like Nasty. She says things like that when she's drunk.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002575|Profit lies in the Free People staying free.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002574|Let the Clerics and the Albs kill each other. That's where the profit lies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002573|Even if this isn't some form of trap, you can't really expect me just to walk into Ignadon?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002572|What? Am I supposed to just give up Tavar and become some 'captain' for the Clerics?|He sees 'Field Commander' as a demotion.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002571|We don't have enough good people ourselves, without supplying them to fight for the Clerics. Ulbricht will have to risk his own people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002570|If I could spare someone then I would have sent them already. You will have to look elsewhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002569|Then you must find someone from among the Free Peoples. The Clerics will never follow an Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002566|No. My place is here. This role is not for me. You must find another for this task.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002565|Judicator Ulbricht is looking for an experienced field commander to lead his troops against the Albs in Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002564|Who the fuck are you?|Aggressive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002563|Sure. Okay.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002562|You really want to know?|Baiting the hook
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002561|Ha...Already got them. They're overrated.|Amused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002560|Fuck off.|Dismissive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002559|Don't hassle me with anything trivial. We don't want to fall out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002558|Come back when you've got business.|Advice, not a threat.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002557|Maybe.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002556|Who are you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002555|Good, then I've found the commander they need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002554|He needs an experienced commander who can help bring the Free People together. And, he's desperate.|With humour
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002553|You'd better not be trollshitting me about this. And you'd better be ready to fight.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002552|You think they can deal with that? Then, I'm in. As long as you join me in this.|Amused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002550|I'll leave for the Hort and talk to this Ulbricht|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002549|A chem dealing outlaw who kills Clerics and doesn't believe in Calaan?|Amused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002548|I'm ready to deal with any trollshit they think about me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002547|They know my history, they know I can lead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002546|If we can convince them you can lead their force.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002545|So, sure, whatever, let's go and fuck up some Albs. Better than wasting away here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002544|I took the Fort, I planned it, I led it. What have I done since?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002543|You're sure?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002542|Yeah, he must be desperate. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002541|Ha. Well, if it's desperate times, that's what I do best. I'm in.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002540|And, this Cleric is so desperate he'll ask an Outlaw to lead his men?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002539|You captured the Fort didn't you? And, you want a new challenge. Destroying the Albs' Converter in Ignadon, now that's a challenge.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002538|And, what difference am I supposed to make?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002537|And, you think fighting a battle in Ignadon for the Clerics will help?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002536|Albs want all the Elex, be it in Ignadon, Edan or Tavar. They will come here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002535|Do you really believe in all this shit? Causes don't get you anywhere. Why should I fight for them?|Raw nerve
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002534|Edan. They hate the Berserkers. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002533|And with Ignadon gone, where do the Albs go next?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002532|Me? Why would I help the Clerics clear up their problems?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002531|I think you should take that command.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002529|Ulbricht needs a field commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002528|Good, then the Clerics and Albs can take care of each other. It's the Clerics' damn fault we have Albs in the first place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002527|The Judicator Ulbricht is planning a huge offensive against in the Albs in Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002526|This better be important.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002525|Why are you talking to me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002524|What an asshole.|Annoyed (not yelled)
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002523|How often did you think you can keep annoying me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002522|Piss...off.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002520|So, unless you've got some real business, or unless my brother the Duke sent you take the talk to someone else.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002518|Listen, I meet a dickhead a day, who tries lines on me.|Resigned/irritated
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002517|Right. So... Leave me be.|Hint - what are you still doing here?
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002516|All right, I don't want trouble. I'm going. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002515|You want to know who I am? |Baiting the hook
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002514|Just tell me who you are.|Polite
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002513|Tough...shit.|Letting the player down
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002512|I was hoping at least one person in the Fort knows what's going on. Are you that person?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002511|So tell me what you want, or leave me the fuck alone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002510|What makes you think you're so important?|Irritated
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002509|I rea-lly don't like small talk .|Serious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002508|Power, shards and an easy life, how about you?|Answer to what do you want?
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002507|What the fuck do you want?|Hostile, calm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002506|What?|Hostile, calm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002505|We should agree plans before we act.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002504|Come to me as soon as you ready, commander. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002503|And, I will hope to see you amongst our forces when we begin our attack against the Converter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002502|Very, well, I will put my trust in you and in the commander you have brought us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002501|I heard of the battle for the Fort. It was a good plan. You saved lives with it.|Respectful.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002500|Do you stand ready to help save Magalan from the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002499|And what does she have to say for herself?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002498|Relax, both of you. You need to work together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002497|Do you stand ready to cut the shit and get to the point? Do you need a commander, or was this a waste of fucking time?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002496|She led the Duke's forces when they took the Fort from Bloody Baxter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002495|You think she has the experience we need?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002494|Nasty, the sister of the Duke of Tavar, will lead your army.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002493|We must find an experienced commander, if Magalan is to be free. They will need to be skilled and ruthless to succeed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002492|May Calaan and good fortune be with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002491|You should ask the leaders of the other Factions if they will take on this role. If they decline, try their commanders.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002490|You sound like you really believe we will find someone out there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002489|Someone willing to risk themselves to stop the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002488|Faith and necessity sometimes breed hope.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002487|Someone willing to lead from the front by example.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002486|Find someone with experience of leading troops in battle.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002485|Be they Separatist, Berserker, or Outlaw.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002484|This Commander will be a symbol of the need for us to work together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002483|Good. Then go out to the other Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002482|Yes, I will  find you the commander you need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002481|Will you go out as an ambassador to the Free People? Speak to those who lead the other factions. Find me someone with experience. Someone independent. Someone who can lead. That in itself will give you a hand in shaping all our futures.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002480|If that is so important why entrust it to someone who has just walked in through your doors. Do you always trust people so easily?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002479|I trust my faith...and there is something about you that tells me you have a part to play in all that will come. Faith will show me the way. But, perhaps you are intended for a different role.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002478|Or, do you have another reason for not wanting to be considered?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002477|I don't know. My memories of those time are only fragments. Though I'm sure I was betrayed so someone could take my place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002476|What about you? You've seen the world. You must understand something of the Albs. Will you fight with us? Soldier or commander, we need people who have seen the world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002475|No? Well, humility is an important trait in a leader.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002474|I don't have the knowledge required to lead men in a battle like this. We need someone who has commanded soldiers. Someone with the tactical skill to take a heavily defended position.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002473|No, no. That is far from my skill set. Logistics, defense and interpreting Calaan's Commandments are where my strengths lie. We need someone like you, an experience commander. Someone who understands the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002472|What about you? Can you lead the attack?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002471|The shortage of a commander with real field experience.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002470|And, the death of Judicator Johann has left us with another issue.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002469|They can't do the same with people. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002468|The answer to that should be obvious when you walk round the Hort. While our production lines have made up for our losses in fighting machines.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002467|Surely they get stronger while you are waiting?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002466|Why have you waited so long to attack?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002465|But, the attacks we've suffered took too many brave souls. Souls who would have been better improving Magalan than lining graves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002464|We need to attack the Converter, but it will take a major offensive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002463|And that will cost us in lives and material.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002462|The Converter has to be taken out of operation. It is the only way to free Ignadon.|Determined
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002461|And, the longer they sit there, the more time they have to prepare.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002460|Then I can only hope they haven't brought up any more reinforcements.|Knowing this is a serious force he faces already
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002459|Perhaps, securing that was the extent of their plans. Or, perhaps they are just waiting for us to attack it before they strike again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002458|The most recent information I have is that Commander Jurek has three garrisons, supported by fighting machines and Colossi.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002457|What do you know about the Alb forces?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002456|And we know that the Albs have used the time to entrench themselves deeper at that damned converter of theirs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002455|But, for the price that was paid there was one exacted, and the Albs haven't attacked us in such strength again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002454|So, if you are here working for the Albs, you'll see nothing that's not known already.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002453|Well, that is my hope. They could simply be massing for a bigger assault. We've had time to retrain, regroup, but it is hardly a secret that we are short of personnel.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002452|The death of Judicator Johann was a particular shock.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002451|It has been some time since their last major assault, But, I'm sure you know that already, Commander Jax.|With an edge, reminding the player character of their part in this.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002450|Are the Albs still attacking the Hort?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002449|Will you wait for an Alb attack, or strike first?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002448|You truly have left you past behind, Commander Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002447|And, when the time comes...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002446|Let it lead us to victory against the Ice Palace. May our faith in each other save us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002445|Let this example show the way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002444|Let this victory stand as an example to all the Free People. It is possible to take the fight to the Albs and win.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002443|I had put my faith in you, but you have far exceeded what I could have dared to hope.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002442|With this action you have saved the Free People, for now at least.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002441|It is frightening to think of what would have happened if the Albs had defeated you. It is likely that Ignadon would have fallen and then all of Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002440|Then there are many who can breathe a sigh of relief.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002439|The Converter has been shut down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002438|I would ask you to mind what you say until you can speak with Judicator Reinhold. His words will be clearer than mine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002437|But, know this. It is faith that binds the Clerics together. Faith that makes the Hort the rock that has held back the Albs. Faith in knowledge, faith in each other, faith in success, all these come before Calaan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002436|So, you have learned a truth that was well hidden. And, now you also know I learned that truth and kept the secret.|Measuring the player character's attitude to this
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002435|Calaan is no god. You're worshipping a spacecraft from the Old World|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002434|We each have a part to play in Calaan's great plan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002433|Calaan says the past is there to teach us, not judge us. Renounce your past, and you can come to Calaan in wisdom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002432|That will take courage. And, in these bleak days courage is vital, if we are to save this world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002431|I was a wanderer, now I seek a cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002430|Or, have you really escaped the Elex and seen the life there is outside Xacor. Commander Jax, the Alb, standing here. That is not something I would have believed, yet here you stand.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002429|So, are you here seeking protection? To save your own skin?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002428|I am free from Elex, I am exiled from the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002427|I was betrayed and now I'm being hunted by my own people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002426|Then you have renounced the Hybrid and joined the Free People? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002425|Are you lying, or are you here to kill me? Draw your weapon here and this cathedral will be a grave to both of us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002424|I'm not here to kill you. I was Jax. Now, I am trying to find who I am.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002423|Since when do Albs come to talk? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002422|And, you walk in here and confess that?|Sceptical
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002421|But, you must have questions. Ask and may Calaan bring you enlightenment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002420|Well, whoever you were, shouldn't matter. The present counts for all and yesterday for little.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002419|Nobody? No one is that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002418|I am just a man looking for the true faith.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002417|I am nobody.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002416|I don't know who I am now, but I was Jax, an Alb Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002415|I need an ambassador for this task, someone who can take my proposals to the other factions, but to know if you are suitable for this role, I must know who you are. And, I need an honest answer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002414|We must find a way to persuade the other factions to agree to work with us. Then together we can destroy the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002413|We must work together if we are to survive. But we must work together with Calaan to lead us all. |Sceptical
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002412|And, you think the other factions should serve under the Clerics.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002411|You need to find someone to unite the factions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002410|You Clerics really do have delusions of grandeur.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002409|The Clerics shall prevail and I hope that the other factions can realize this in time to save themselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002408|The will of Calaan shall be made real. We will drive them from the Convertor in the north and from the lands of all the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002407|And, the answer can only be the Albs. You've seen them. The Convertors they build on our lands.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002406|But, if you ask me if we can hold out against the Berserkers, the Outlaws and the Albs then I would ask whose interest would the destruction of the Hort serve?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002405|So, we shall continue to do so, if it is Calaan's will that we should do so.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002404|We Clerics were the first of the factions to rise after the ashes of the Comet and while other alliances have come and gone, we have prevailed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002403|Faith is a weapon that can achieve much. I believe in Calaan. I believe in the technology he has given us and in the men and women who carry it.|Devout, convinced
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002402|But, do you really expect you can beat them with the forces you have here in the Hort?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002401|The Clerics say that they are leading the fight against the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002400|Then talk.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002399|You should. You have carried your own burden and that of others for too long. Here, you will find others to share that load.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002398|Tell me what you want.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002397|Oh, faith sells itself... But, sometimes it helps to point people in the right direction.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002396|I need to talk to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002395|Thank you for your offer. I'll think about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002394|It sounds like you're trying a sales pitch on me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002393|Let me get a look at you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002392|You are free of it now you have reached us here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002391|Whatever you have seen...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002390|Now, there is a face that shows the world as it is. Conflict, friendship, betrayal and trust.|Assessing the player character.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002389|Ah, yes. The newcomer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002388|Only faith will free the people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002387|Contact details for...Ray. Research indicates he is capable of making the shot needed to hit the thruster on an Alb raider...Zardom used Ray to shoot down my raider!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002386|Ray, Ray, Ray. I am interested to hear what excuse he gives me this time. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002385|Now, where is Zardom? Wherever he is, this gives me a good chance to look through his things.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002384|The less Elex the Albs have, the weaker they become and the safer it is for the rest of our world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002383|We're almost there... But, only almost.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002382|How are you getting on with the raider?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002381|I need some more time to check it over, all right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002380|Well, no, no....I'll tell you when I'm sure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002379|What is it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002378|There is one thing that's worrying me about the raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002377|Right, I will get to work and install it now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002376|Hey, yeah, that will do it... That is a miracle right there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002375|I found a replacement reactor coil for the raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002374|Chances are there could be a replacement reactor coil.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002373|Have a look at what you can find there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002372|I've been there before and there were a lot of bits of tech that our modern stuff is based on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002371|It's down in the basement, which is how it survived the Fall.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002370|There's an old research lab there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002369|The only place I can think of is a set of ruins in western Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002367|But, where are we supposed to get an X48 reactor coil?|Thinking it through
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002366|Yeah.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002365|I need that raider operational.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002364|Then what do we do now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002363|Yes, that thing won't last more than two kilometers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002362|You said the reactor coil needs replacing?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002361|That reactor coil won't last for long, I'm afraid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002360|Ask your question and I will see if I can answer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002359|Return to me when you have more to report.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002358|We need everything complete before I will share my plans with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002357|Get the raider finished.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002356|Then are you going to tell me your plans?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002355|Good, it could prove useful.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002354|Now, it falls to us to cause the Albs another setback. I must finish my work before it is too late.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002353|Still, it is the first good news I've heard from Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002352|A success is too optimistic. It has delayed the Albs, not defeated them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002351|Then you have even more motivation to reach the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002350|Yes, but it seems Kallax still thinks I must be killed.|Bitter about Kallax
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002349|And you survived?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002348|Sadly, I doubt that means he's dead. His disappearance must be part of his plan. Whatever that may be.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002347|Nothing until I can find him, he's disappeared.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002346|What will you do now you know Zardom was responsible for the attack?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002345|Then you were betrayed by your own.|Stress on were
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002344|Then you know what you must do next.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002343|But, the Albs must lose all their influence on the lands of the free people, and you must be ready to deliver on your promise to reach the Hybrid. Then you will have earned my trust.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002342|You've made progress.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002341|Do you have anything else to report?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002340|Yes. And?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002339|Good. What else can you report?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002338|My raider is almost ready. The mechanic is preparing to bring the reactor online.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002337|Ulbricht's offensive against the Albs in Ignadon was a success.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002336|Kallax trapped me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002334|You were right, Zardom was behind the attack on my raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002333|Fail a mission and die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002332|Kallax serves the Hybrid, he was following the Directive.|Realising the truth
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002331|Hah, Albs kill each other all the time. Fail a mission and you're executed. Run and you're shot in the back. Or, in your case, Kallax came to have you executed. Yes, I had heard that too.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002330|Who planned the failure of my mission? Did they want me to die, or did they want Thorald to live? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002329|Thorald wants to strike at the Hybrid by destroying the Elex that feeds it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002328|Has his vision failed, leaving me to act outside the Directive? Or, am I merely part of his greater plan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002327|But, what is the Hybrid using the Elex for?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002326|To learn the truth, to kill the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002325|And so, full circle. Sent to Hybrid. I go back to the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002324|But, what is it that Xacor is really defending? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002323|Unquestioning, serving the Hybrid and my addiction to Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002321|The Hybrid's stronghold that I defended for so long.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002320|And so, full circle. Sent to Thorald from the Ice Palace. To learn the truth, to kill the truth and now I return.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002319|So, what are you planning to do when you get to the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002318|But, it is far from simple to achieve.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002317|Removing Elex from this world is our best hope.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002316|If you want me to believe you will help me stop the Hybrid, then you get inside each of those Converters and you shut them down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002303|So, what are your plans for getting into the Ice Palace?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002302|Very well, but there is much to discuss.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002301|Kill, or convert. My studies indicate that Mana will poison him, kill him if we must. But, there is also a chance we can change him with it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002299|You're getting ahead of yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002298|First you've got to tell me your plans. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002297|Now, we take the war to the Hybrid. Now, the Hybrid must die so everyone can be free.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002296|You want to kill the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002295|We have a real chance to win the war now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002294|It seems you can deliver on your word. I would not have thought it possible for anyone to shut down all of the Converters. Your deeds will be remembered by all the Free People!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002293|Well, I say your people, but perhaps you have earned my trust enough to separate you from the Albs in Xacor. Perhaps, we can work together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002291|We have little to discuss until those Converters are silent.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002290|Then on behalf of the Free People, I thank you. The Converters are the worst thing your people ever did to us.|Pleased, amused.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002289|There are no more active Converters. I shut them all down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002288|The Albs are still fueling their Converter in east Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002287|The Converter in west Xacor is still in operation. It's the most heavily guarded.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002286|The Converter in Ignadon is still operational.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002285|The Converter in Tavar remains fully functional.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002284|The Converter in south Abessa is still active.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002283|The Converters you wanted destroyed...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002281|Wardek has fled. Kallax was answering orders. If you ask me you should be looking to the actions of Zardom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002280|No Alb can refuse an order from the Hybrid.|Working it through
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002279|And, had you failed? Certainly, your raider crashed, but you were in Edan. Your mission had only just started. It sounds more like someone wanted it stopped. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002278|No Alb would dare, I was on a mission ordered directly by the Hybrid.|Calm question
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002277|Near Goliet? That's unlikely. From what you've told me, I'd say it was your own people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002276|Then was it the Separatists?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002275|What I can tell you is it wasn't us. You might have been flying over Edan, but no Berserker caused your crash.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002274|If we could shoot Alb raiders down we'd do it more often.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002273|Until you told me different I had assumed it was mechanical trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002272|Perhaps, you could find a suitable component in those ruins.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002271|I have been there once before. In the Old World, they had some sort of research lab there. I believe much Cleric and Alb technology is based on what was developed there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002270|But...there is an old industrial park not far to the north of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002269|Well, you won't find stockpiles of Alb spares around here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002268|But, if I had access to spares, I could get it to fly again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002266|It won't fly right now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002265|An Alb raider would definitely be an asset. How badly damaged is it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002264|It sounds like he too has enemies in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002263|The lands of the Free People cannot fall.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002262|Wardek has joined the Separatists in Abessa. I see I know more about your own people than you do...|Informing then wry surprise the player character doesn't know this.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002261|Wardek left without an escort. There are Alb forces searching for him, we've captured some of them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002260|That makes no sense...|Finding it hard to believe.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002259|I know too that your father Wardek didn't leave Xacor under orders, he fled to Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002258|What we know we've learned from prisoners. That means I know who you are, Commander Jax. We learned recently it was you who had crashed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002257|What do you know about the Elexetors?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002256|Well, we will see if that is true once the Hybrid and the Elexetors are gone. Until then, they are the enemy.|Willing to see if this is true.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002255|So, all the other Albs are their victims too? They're controlled by the Elexetors? |Sceptical
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002253|Then the Albs will conquer Ignadon and take control of all the Elex there. That will damn us as sure as the Albs defeating us here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002252|The fate of all the Free People is linked. If Ulbricht launches his offensive against the Albs and the Clerics fail...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002251|And, we might find it again by coming together to fight the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002250|True, but we've made peace before.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002249|Will you help us?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002248|Those machines have fed the Albs for too long.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002247|Do you really believe you can transmute all of the Elex on Magalan at once?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002246|Come to me when you have something to report.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002245|I hope you are what you say you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002244|Trust must be earned.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002243|Succeed in yours and perhaps I will tell you more of my plans. Until then...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002242|You have your task. I have mine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002241|That is none of your business.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002240|What are you going to do?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002239|But, that is your choice, you know the task you have been set. If you want my help, you must shut down those Converters.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002238|If I am to help you reach the Ice Palace, I need help repairing an Alb raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002237|You should hold only the Elexetors and the Hybrid responsible for the Converters.|Putting the blame on the leaders
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002236|The Albs aren't the only ones killing people. The Free People kill Albs and they kill each other.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002235|If you know so much, then can you tell me who shot my raider down?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002234|You expect me to deactivate all five Converters?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002233|And, it's delayed you and your research each time. |Calm, spelling it out
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002232|You've told me nothing that couldn't have been guessed at.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002231|No. If you want me to believe you can get me into the Ice Palace then first you can show me that you can get inside an Alb Converter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002230|Based on a few words?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002229|When all five of those Converters have stopped, then I will believe you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002228|I'm supposed to trust you with the future of Magalan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002227|I trained with the Elexetors, I know how they think. I know my way around the Ice Palace. Do you really think you can reach the Hybrid without me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002224|Now, do as I asked and leave.|Dismissing the idea
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002223|You've talked, you've said nothing.|Dismissing the idea
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002222|Not alone, but you have a plan to get in. Take me with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002221|Then you're out of luck. There's no way to get in unnoticed, you won't even make it up the ramp to the gates.|Dismissing the idea
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002219|Whatever is happening in Xacor has to be why someone sabotaged my mission and had me set for execution. We both need to get into the Ice Palace.|Straight
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002218|Whatever the Hybrid is doing, he's close to succeeding.|Calm, spelling it out
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002217|He has time on his side, you don't.|Trying to convince Thorald to help him
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002216|And, what do you want in return for helping me?|Fact, then relenting, what if the player character has a point.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002215|I've dealt with several Albs that have tried.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002214|When my raider crashed, I was on a mission to find you to learn more.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002213|If the Hybrid still wants that information, he'll send someone else to finish the mission and to kill you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002212|That gives you power and makes Elex both unusable by the Hybrid and poisonous to Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002211|That you're planning to transmute it into Mana. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002210|That you are researching the properties of Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002209|Let's say you're speaking the truth. Tell me what the Hybrid knows about my plans.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002208|The fact you're still breathing. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002207|Thank you, I need time and I need space. These questions...they are incredibly complex.|Distracted
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002206|What's to say you aren't still serving the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002205|If you've got into the Ice Palace by that point, what do you care?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002204|That's not the best motive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002202|I trust you. You get your revenge, and then what's to stop you taking Elex and turning back into an Alb?|Explaining how things could work ''if' I trust you and then you get your revenge'
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002201|So, you want my help to get revenge?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002200|I am an Alb. Well, I was before the Elex cleared my system. It was my raider that was shot down in the mountains near Goliet. I was betrayed by my own people and I want to know why.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002199|So, what are you? A Separatist, a spy, or a liar?|suspicious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002198|The only people who have been inside the Ice Palace are Albs.|Doubtful
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002197|I can help you. I know my way around the Ice Palace. I can get you to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002196|And, how did you get that information?|Concerned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002195|What exactly do you 'think' you know?|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002194|My plan to stop the Hybrid?|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002193|Well, we will see if he agrees.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002192|Thorald is fighting against the Hybrid. Make him understand that you share a cause and don't take no for an answer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002191|Why would Thorald tell me what he knows?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002190|I know about your plan to stop the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002189|You've had your warning. You need to leave.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002188|Move on, now.|Military, polite, firm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002187|Sorry, I will leave now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002186|Leave this area, I have much work to do here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002185|I warned you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002184|This is your last warning. Interrupt my meditation further and there will be consequences.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002182|Magalan cannot afford for my work to fail.|Military, polite
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002181|I've told you, I have no time for distractions.|Military, polite
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002180|So, I'm going to ask you once more.|Military, polite
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002179|What are you going to do if I don't leave?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002178|Who are you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002177|Your search is none of my concern, please leave.|Polite, but firm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002176|You don't know what I am looking for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002175|Whatever you're looking for, you won't find it here. Please, leave immediately.|Polite, but firm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002174|So, come on. Get me the stuff I need, or the Duke will have us both flayed alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002173|But, hey, I'll keep a handle on the Duke. I won't just blow anything up just like that. This thing is powerful and I am its safety valve.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002172|You'll see something almost no one has seen. I mean...bang! This bang. This Big Bang! How can you not want to see that power?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002171|Ah, come on forget about him, you're helping me. And, this is a once in a lifetime. This will take you back in time. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002170|I'm not helping that madman build his bomb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002168|Konrad must have set off to deliver the Big Bang.|Realising what this means
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002167|He's gone.|Seeing Konrad isn't there
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002164|I guess, I'm lucky I'm free!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002163|Yeah, I bet he does. If I was him, I'd want me dead. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002162|The Duke wants you dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002161|You can leave me to it and, be ready for the light show!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002160|This will take me some time, but you can tell the Duke, everything is running smoothly here...just about. I think.|Growing less certain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002159|I'll need time to finish her, but then, she is going to fly! You wait till you see her in action, this is going to be incredible!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002158|This should finish the job. I hope.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002157|That's it, that's all I need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002156|You found one! The desert isn't just sand, she has everything you need, if you just look for it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002155|The cross-armature coil.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002154|I'll get that fitted right away. We're one step closer!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002153|Here. The proprietary Edwards condenser.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002152|Good, good, good, that will fix the inconsistencies in the first cycle. That means we shouldn't evaporate ourselves trying to use this.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002151|Here is the inverse phase inductor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002150|That's not the full list though, so time to get me the rest.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002149|Just a few more pieces and she'll be ready! Better hurry it up!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002148|Get the rest of the components and the Big Bang will finally, bang! And, blast, and vaporize. You'd better hurry, the Duke is waiting!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002147|I think I flat outdid myself there. I'm proud of her.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002146|Well, that was a hell of a plan there in the Fort wasn't it? Did you see the show? Heh, Big Bang didn't let me down.|Enthusiastic
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002145|Look for a cloud of those things and you'll find the machines.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002144|They drink the oil, or something.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002143|You can spot them in the desert because of those insectoid things.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002142|Find some pre-Comet tech and you should find the things we need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002141|Some of these components are specialist, but the others are just out there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002140|Okay, okay. Let me think...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002139|Mh... Well, let's forget it. It was all a bit tense there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002138|You deserved it, asshole.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002137|I am sorry.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002136|Yeah, I might have.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002135|Anything else, asshole?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002134|Yeah? Now, you're sounding like an Outlaw. And, I'm not risking going back to where I was before!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002133|I remember you threatening me when I was still prisoner in the Duke's rocket silo.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002132|Hey, hey, relax, okay? Relax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002131|Here, will these shards help your memory?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002130|It's both our lives on the line with the Duke. You have to have some idea.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002129|Tell me where to find the components, or I'll start breaking bones.|humane minus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002128|A bomb is explosives. 'Bang'|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002127|Mh... Although...|Remembering the player's action
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002126|It's going to take something else to follow up after Big Bang. So, I need a little bit of time to do some planning.|Something else = something amazing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002125|Take a break and do some thinking.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002124|What are you doing now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002123|You should be thanking me for trying!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002122|Ignadon as a crater and Tavar as all powerful, how is that good for anyone?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002121|You'd rather the Duke unleashed that power on Ignadon? Or, on Edan? Yes, I built it, but he knew what he wanted and he would've found someone to do it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002120|Do you see me laughing?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002119|Come on, you must see the justice in that!? And the humor, it was hilarious!|Amused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002118|A weapon that would destroy them. The Duke working to wipe out his own men.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002117|You put a weapon of mass destruction in the hands of Outlaws!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002116|And, you wait until you see her in action. None of us were here when the Comet hit, and she's the closest you're going to get to that!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002115|Oh, yeah. Yeah! I mean we're not inventing anything here, this is recreating. They used to have these things before the Comet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002114|Do you think you will ever finish that thing?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002113|No, no way. I'm not leaving her. I'm not leaving Big Bang until she's finished.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002112|Help me to hell! We'd both be dead, two idiots into the fire together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002111|I'm a Cleric, I can help you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002110|Without protection and completely alone - I wouldn't survive 24 hours out there!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002109|What? Have you seen that desert? Have you tried kicking chems?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002108|Why haven't you escaped?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002107|Should've died, would've died, but the Duke wanted a pet. Hooked me up on chems and told me his plan. And, she is a thing of be-auty ...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002106|I was in the wrong place at the right time. Or, the right place at the wrong time. On duty in Ignadon when Outlaws crashed into us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002105|Captured, set free. It's hard to remember now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002104|How did you get here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002099|Finding them is down to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002098|You think I've been out in the desert? How should I know?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002097|Where can I find the components you need?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002096|He wanted Big Bang ready to go last month. And, she's not ready to go yet. Not yet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002095|The Duke is starting to get impatient.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002094|It would be good for both of us, if you hurry.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002093|Mh... Definitely, but let's get to the most important stuff first.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002092|Anything else?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002091|And, if you get those, then get you'll need to me a concentric cross-armature coil too.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002090|And, a proprietary Edwards condenser, of course.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002089|So... First and foremost I need an inverse phase conductor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002088|All right, what do you need?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002087|Well, if you're here to help, I need some components. If Big Bang is going to bang she needs a few things.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002086|Hah, I said we're all prisoners here together. All together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002085|What?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002084|The Duke sent me to help you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002083|I get those and she'll be ready to change the world!!!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002082|Then you don't know his genius. Speak to him. Hah, but be careful, he might just kill you if you try.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002081|Well, then you know what I am talking about, right? Ha...He's a visionary!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002080|Yes, I've spoken to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002079|No.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002078|But, I am only an emissary, an artist working to create the Duke's vision. Have you spoken to him yet? The Duke?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002077|I just need a few more things and she will fly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002076|Almost.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002075|Big Bang? The Comet's Daughter? The Firebringer? She's almost done. Almost.|Enthused - he has given the fighting machine a name
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002074|How is the bomb coming along?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002073|Hah, Whoever owns this would only need to do it to one city and then no one will mess with him again!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002072|Xacor, Abessa, Edan. Do you think any of them is going to mess with the Duke once they know he can evaporate their asses?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002071|Pick one, the King of the Desert has a lot of enemies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002070|Which city does the Duke want to destroy?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002068|Who knows? Depends how big we build it, but from my calculations it will destroy a city at least, but who cares exactly what goes up? This is a thing of beauty..be-auty.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002067|The Duke wants to destroy a whole city?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002066|This won't blow up a few mutants. This, this will evaporate a whole damn city. This is Big Bang!|Proud
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002065|A bomb? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002064|You're building a bomb?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002063|I am building...the end of the world. |Theatrical
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002062|The Comet's going to have nothing on what the Duke's got me putting together.|Proud
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002061|I am working on...the infernal machine!|Theatrical
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002060|What are you doing down here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002059|So, if you're not a prisoner, what do you want from me, Konrad the creator?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002058|Everyone thinks that at the start.|Wry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002057|Neither, I'm no prisoner.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002056|Which one are you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002055|Everyone here did. They were forced here, or they came because they didn't have anywhere else to go. Either way, we're prisoners.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002054|What makes you think I committed a crime?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002053|What crimes did you commit to end up here?|Cheerful enquiry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002052|Life is a prison and we all serve our time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002051|Umm...what did I want to do?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002050|I have completed my work and brought you the pieces you require.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002049|Talk is cheap, get out there and get me profits.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002048|Go, get out. And, find him if you know what's good for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002047|Or get the fuck out of Tavar, before I have you flayed alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002046|Get the job done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002045|Take care of Konrad yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002044|But, you keep all of this to yourself. Understand?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002043|You'll get paid once he's dead. Now, get after him!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002042|How about you pay in advance?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002041|Here, take this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002040|Well, that's the main thing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002039|You wanted him dead, he's dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002038|And, did you make the bastard suffer?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002037|Konrad is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002036|Those fucking Clerics, I should have known.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002035|Kill him and you will be well rewarded.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002034|Then find him!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002033|He's already run.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002032|I want him dead now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002031|You're saying that shithead betrayed me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002030|He built Big Bang to destroy Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002029|What are you talking about?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002028|Konrad had different plans for Big Bang.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002027|And, we are still receiving communication signals coming from the Hort. Does that sound like it's been annihilated?|Angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002026|If it was at its target then the Clerics' stronghold would have been erased, annihilated.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002025|What the fuck are you talking about?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002024|Big Bang is at its target.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002023|Or, I'll feed you both to the jackals.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002022|Get Konrad to finish the damn job. Either, Big Bang gets to its target.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002021|Say, are you deaf?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002020|So, go and make sure it is sent to its target. Move.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002019|I said the job was to be finished. It isn't finished until Big Bang is launched.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002018|No, it is still here|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002017|Is it already on the way to its target?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002016|If that's true then where is Big Bang now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002015|You got the job done?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002014|Big Bang has been completed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002013|Then get it done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002012|I'll take the job.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002011|One more question.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002010|Right.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002009|More disposable by the minute if you keep standing there talking.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002008|I'm disposable?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002007|Get the job finished.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002006|No questions. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002005|If he doesn't finish his job soon, I'll kill him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002004|There, there's your job. Now, get the fuck out of here and get it done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002003|If he dies...you die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002002|Oh, and to be clear, you might be disposable, but Konrad isn't. Make sure he is kept alive until the job is done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002001|And, then I'll kill you. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00002000|Tell him I want the job finished. And then, you do whatever he needs doing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001999|Find Konrad. You will find him in the rocket silo.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001998|All right.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001997|A job...?|Considering the player
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001996|If you want profit, give me a job.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001995|Not trouble, just answers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001994|And, yet you're still talking and not getting to the point. Are you sure you're not looking for trouble.|calm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001993|Do you want my help?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001992|I need your help? That's a new one.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001991|Tell me what you want.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001990|So, give me the right answers.|calm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001989|Now, you're starting to ask the right questions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001988|I'll give you thirty seconds.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001987|I only want to talk, I don't want trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001986|So, what will you pay me for my loyalty?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001985|Then you need my help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001984|Words like that have to be earned.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001983|Your choice. You can give me profits, or I'll cause you problems.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001982|I just want to talk.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001981|It doesn't matter where shards come from, it's whose pocket they end up in that counts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001980|How can I make you a profit?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001979|If you want to make your way in Tavar, you'll need to start with profit. Only that and loyalty count. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001978|Which are you bringing me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001977|Profit, or problems?|Terse
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001976|They changed me. Their Mana changed me and that change just won't stop.|Growing concerned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001975|I am here now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001974|What kept you?|Needling, humorous
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001973|Just don't keep me waiting, or you might find I change my mind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001972|I will meet you by the gate.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001971|You should stock up here before we go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001970|I will wait by the main gate and we will see if your actions can match your words.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001969|And...it's not like I have other options. Not in the long term. You're right. I'm hiding from it here. I need to get out there and find a real solution.|Echoing his 'and', pained by the decision.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001968|And I know what it's like when all that is taken from you. We can help each other.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001967|I know the nightmares and the problems of trying to control power that really wants to control you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001966|The longer you stay here the more danger you put these people in. If you really want to protect them you need to leave.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001965|I was an Alb. I know Elex and I know magic. I know the impulses that follow you even during sleep. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001964|Even if that's true, why should I leave with you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001963|You said yourself, the longer you are here the more you fear your powers will overwhelm you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001962|In return, I will help your quest to find the Elex you are searching for. Then you can improve your magical abilities.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001959|And you think I will take part in this?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001958|And I am trying to put together a group skilled enough to win that fight.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001957|I am going to end this war by taking the fight to the Elexetors.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001956|We're going to have to work on our communication skills.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001955|And what exactly is it that you are planning?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001954|What do you think? My offer still stands.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001953|I'm sorry, okay. Can we just talk without arguing?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001952|Then don't provoke me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001951|I don't have to work on anything. I don't have to have anything to do with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001950|Keep your attitude to yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001949|And neither of us know what that means we are now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001948|We've both been fed Elex in one form or another, and it's changed us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001947|Well, it seems we have something in common.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001946|Took it? You were fed it. You were an Alb soldier.|Leaping on the admission, showing what she's figured out
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001945|In that case, mine has nothing to do with you and we can part company right here, right now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001944|My life has nothing to do with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001943|I care that you're hiding something. So, tell me the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001942|Yeah, yeah. Don't lie to me. I don't care if you take chems, if you've tried magic, that's not the issue.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001941|Keep your damn questions to yourself.|Harsh
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001940|I'm not different, you must be mistaken.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001939|I took Elex in the past. Is that what you're seeing, or is there something else?|Evasive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001938|You have it mark on you. You are different somehow. What is it about you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001937|What do you know of what I need? What do you know of how to help me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001936|I could help you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001935|"Use", there's a word I've heard too much. Well, count me out. I'm not interested in being "used".|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001934|I could use someone like you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001933|Now, I need to find a solution myself. But, to do that I need to study the properties of Elex to learn more about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001932|The Warlords wanted to test me. To try my powers, to harness them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001931|But, sometimes it overwhelms me. That's why I fight alone. If I lose control of a spell, there's a chance I could kill anyone and everyone around me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001930|I do, I have.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001929|If that's true, why don't you use your power?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001928|I am becoming stronger and stronger. It is terrifying.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001927|Ever since my power started to grow.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001926|There are those in Edan who want to use my magic for their own purposes.|Diplomatic
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001925|Exiled? No.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001924|Have you been exiled from Goliet?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001923|My only connection to Edan is my magic. I wish it was more, but...wishes don't make things so.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001922|I stand as their protector against anyone who would force them to do otherwise.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001921|I don't answer to Edan. And these people belong to no faction, they belong only to themselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001920|Well, the Clerics keep order, but it's not like the Hort where entry means you have to join their order. Here, you can forget about factions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001919|So, there's no faction in charge here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001918|If the people here wanted to join a faction they would have. But, some people aren't ready for that. Or they've been cast out. They have to go somewhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001917|This is a place away from the war. A place people can make up their minds without being pressured to join one of the factions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001916|Damn, this is like being back in Goliet all over again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001915|You know you wouldn't need to defuse things if you didn't get people wound up in the first place?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001914|Woah, no, no, no...no, I'm trying to defuse things.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001913|Are you trying to pick a fight?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001912|Are you always so edgy?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001911|You're a Berserker. Is Edan trying to conquer Abessa?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001910|What brought you out here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001909|This area is a sanctuary for refugees.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001908|This sanctuary is under my protection. You need to understand that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001907|Your place, your rules. I understand.|Concilliatory
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001906|I don't care where you're from, or what you were there. Just leave me be.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001905|Then I hope that means you're here to help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001904|Call it experience. Those in need and those willing to help, don't normally question my motives.|Calm control, wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001903|I'll do what I want, don't get in my way.|humane
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001902|I'm not a reaver.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001901|What's wrong with you. Have I done something to piss you off?|humane
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001900|There's nothing here for reavers, recruiters, or troublemakers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001899|Are you here to seek shelter, or to cause problems?|Calm control
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001898|Well, you've got my support, all right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001897|Lloyd's been great, but he always said he was waiting for someone to take over. I guess that's you, right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001896|Yeah, good.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001895|Yes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001894|Hey, they told me you are trying to take command here. Is that right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001893|I feel much safer now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001892|That's great, great. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001890|Ha...I'll get on with it right away then sir Mr. shit hot dictator whoopdeehey.|Amused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001889|Just get the job done and you can call me whatever you want.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001888|Oh, and how do you want to be addressed now? Sir? Mr. shithot dictator sir? Oh imperial deity of the everlasting whoopdeehey sir?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001887|Well, as long as you don't go turning into a complete asshat now you're in charge then that'll be all right with me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001886|Correct.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001885|So, I heard you've taken over?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001884|Big dreams, constant mutant attacks and no shards, exactly the right thing for schmucks like us, hey?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001883|Yes, it looks like you're stuck with me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001882|Ha... Then welcome to the madness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001881|Hey, so I've heard you've gone and set up camp here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001880|All right then. If you say so.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001879|Then we won't have a problem.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001878|Put these people in danger...Then we'll have a problem.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001877|Protect the people here and you'll have me on your side.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001876|Yes. I hope that isn't a problem.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001875|So...You are in charge around here now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001874|We need all the help we can get.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001873|Okay. Good.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001872|Looks like it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001871|I heard you are one of us now. That you've joined our merry gang?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001870|I would advise you to get him on your side.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001869|But, that mind is useful.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001868|Yes, Eckard is definitely a man with his own mind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001867|I have a few issues with Eckard.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001866|You are making good progress.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001865|That is excellent progress. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001864|You have done well. I'll look forward to hearing more of your exploits.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001863|There are still some things to do and I am sure that you will complete those tasks as well.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001862|Nature abhors a vacuum and other mutants will come, but Origin is safer for the death of those creatures.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001861|Well, you've bought us some time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001860|You made some...interesting choices. But, somehow they fit in with the rest of the group here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001859|Very good. I have already met your companions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001858|You see? Your knowledge, the skills few have here in Origin, together we are stronger.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001857|If anyone can get the raider in the air again, it is Harley.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001856|Land and sky, we shall face them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001855|He has skills that will be needed in the time to come. And I hear you are to work on a raider together, that will be an asset to us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001854|He is a gift.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001853|His dedication has kept Origin safe. It's good that you helped him, he knows now that he has your support.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001852|We all owe him our lives.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001851|Winning him over to your side shows you are the person I thought you were.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001850|Without his skills we would have been overrun by mutants long ago.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001849|Yes, that he is. But, I am glad that he is here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001848|Enough to keep back the mutants and the Alb patrols.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001847|A number of experienced, expert fighters have come to our cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001845|Here is the key.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001844|The big tower you can see at the top of Origin is now yours.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001843|But, a tower is only walls, it is only a symbol. If you would make this your home, your future, you must remember that trust comes in keeping promise not in making them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001842|You have earned the right to stay here amongst us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001841|If you have won the trust of those three, then you have won the trust of the camp.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001840|We will follow and we will hope.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001839|Lead us to a safe future where peace is possible again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001838|I hope you use it wisely. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001837|Now, it is yours.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001836|It was my task to prepare Origin for your arrival.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001835|And, now we come to the part of our agreement that is under my control.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001834|I had no doubt when I saw that you would be successful.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001833|Then you have proved my vision true.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001832|We've got rid of the mutants in the surrounding area.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001831|I helped Eckard secure the camp.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001830|Harley is going to repair my crashed raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001829|Your mechanic Harley appears to be capable.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001828|Your scout Jonesy is very committed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001827|Your camp master, Eckard, is a very determined man.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001825|Modesty and ability together in one person. You will be more than a figurehead, you will be a leader.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001824|I didn't rise from the dead, I narrowly escaped execution.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001823|And, this camp is their point of contact.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001822|The choice, the choice of a world lies before you. To begin to shape that world, you must go out and earn the trust of those who will help build this future.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001821|But, I speak too soon. You should keep my certainty to yourself until it is proven.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001820|Your survival alone has much to teach us and we can only benefit from your instincts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001819|You see the world with a different eye to all those around us. Give that perception to us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001818|I have faith in your choices.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001817|And, if I do things you disapprove of?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001816|If you prove yourself then it will be my job to follow.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001815|That is not for me to say.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001814|What do you think I'm going to do?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001813|Why give me command?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001812|Then... I will give you command of Origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001811|If the people like you then you will have a place to stay here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001810|Fit in.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001809|What do I have to do to be allowed to stay here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001808|So, win their trust. Show them that you believe that too. That you look forward, not back.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001807|Here, all people give up on their belief of the past to build a new future for themselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001806|The Domed City is a shelter for those who want a new start, but who cling to their old past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001805|People, yes. That is the point. We are all people, whatever labels we have put upon us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001804|They are good men. And they are waiting for a leader.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001803|And of course, Harley, our mechanic. You can probably make him happy if you bring him something interesting to repair.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001802|Then there is Eckard, he is responsible for the overall defense of this place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001801|Well, start with those with the most influence, that will persuade the others. There is our scout, our guard Jonesy. He helps protect us from the local mutants.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001800|Who do I have to prove myself to?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001799|If you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001798|You must earn the trust of those who live here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001797|Speak to them, earn their trust, prove your motives.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001796|Then you must prove yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001795|Are you ready to lead?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001794|We are ready to be led.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001793|Origin has been established. Now, it is time to use this tool.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001792|My days are numbered and my work here almost complete. My task was to build this camp, to assemble these people and their skills, to be ready for the day you came.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001791|You want me to lead these people?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001790|You lost the power of the past. But, you didn't crumble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001789|Who, if not you could really make a difference? You who straddles the worlds of Xacor and the Free People, of life and death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001788|Oh no, for here in front of me I see here an upright, strong person and his internal conflict between human and machine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001787|You are Jax, Alb Commander. He who left Xacor. Who was said to be dead, but is risen.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001786|And, who do you think I am?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001785|Let's drop this foolish masquerade. We both know who we are talking about... Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001781|You think I'm the person who can change the world?|Unconvinced
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001780|And, I believe. I believe that that person has come to us here and now today!|Messianic
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001779|One day, one day there will come a person, someone in our midst who can change the world from its very foundations up.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001778|We defy the oppressors and all those who blindly follow them!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001777|We fight for freedom and self-determination.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001776|You are fighting for the Free Peoples?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001775|But, amongst all of those factions are people who have seen this for themselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001774|They are all prisoners to their laws. They are all prisoners of their past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001773|I have seen that the different factions that have risen since the great catastrophe all have one thing in common.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001771|I have seen this world, in all its broken glory.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001770|Tell me about your vision.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001769|No. But, life is always easier when you know the rules of your opponent.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001768|The war is just a game to you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001767|War is like every game. The points are only really counted at the end.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001766|Great vision is always ridiculed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001765|Sounds rather naive for this small group of Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001764|How do you defend this place?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001763|You offer people shelter here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001762|You think you can hold back the Albs on your own?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001761|We are here to provide an alternative. We are here to hold back the Albs, but without all the lies that come with the great factions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001760|Let your weapons rest and draw new strength from our fire and our company.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001759|And, who are the people here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001757|Threatened by the storm from the north, we keep watch with pride and confidence.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001756|Welcome to Origin, stranger. I am Lloyd. Spiritual father and leader of the people here|Calm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001755|Just one seed of hope can grow a whole world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001754|Great changes often sprout from a small idea.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001753|If I get you the conductor, can you repair the engine?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001751|Ha, ha... Yeah. Good joke. What? You're serious?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001749|But, one thing beforehand...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001748|There's so much to fix around here. Fucking heaven in a junkyard.|Sounds disappointed then happy.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001747|But, let me get it working first. I'll tell you later if I need any more parts, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001746|And, even then the reactor is going to be a problem.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001745|I will need a lot of time to get her working again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001744|Well...This thing has just had it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001743|How long to repair it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001742|It was a real struggle to get it here, but here she is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001741|Well? What do you think?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001740|Whatever the payment, half of that baby will be mine, okay? Oh, man, a functional Alb raider and half of it mine. You have got a deal my friend.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001739|Well, alright. I'll drum up a few guys and get it back here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001738|Let's talk payment when you return with the raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001737|But, we didn't discuss payment, did we?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001735|Yeah, yeah. I know what I said.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001734|That's what you said.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001733|Recover it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001732|Now that you have the conductor can you recover the raider?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001730|You have it? Now, that is going to bring a smile to my face. Look at that baby.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001729|Here is the hydraulic conductor you wanted.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001728|Those things are hard to get hold of.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001727|And, did you see the high capacity hydraulic conductor on it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001726|You did?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001725|I took down the fighting colossus in Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001723|It's still active somewhere in the southern mountains in Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001722|But, even though it's faulty, you'd have to be nuts to try and take it on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001721|You see I heard one went rogue due to a faulty control unit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001720|Well, okay, listen: there might be one you could take down a little easier than the full strength ones.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001719|You really think you can bring one of those down?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001718|I can get the conductor from a fighting colossus from the 7300 series?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001716|So, well, I suppose we should forget about it then. I mean it's not impossible to get one, but it might as well be, huh?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001715|They also have one of those high capacity conductors installed in them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001714|Or... Well, yeah, you could bring down of those fighting colossi from the 7300 series.|Considering.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001713|I suppose you could get one from another raider, but no idea how you're going to do that...|Considering.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001712|And you don't just find something like that lying around.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001711|Well... I would need a high capacity hydraulic conductor to get it back in order.|Considering.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001710|Can you repair the engine?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001709|But, if the engine were still intact then I suppose someone might be able to fly it here. Then I could really have a go at getting it working.|Considering.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001708|Not out there in the mountains, no.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001707|Do you think you can repair it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001706|The thing was a bit of a wreck. It had hit the mountain further up and then come down the side of it. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001705|So, I got by the Berserker patrols in Edan and went up to the old observatory and had a closer look at it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001704|I told myself this is my chance to see one of those things up close.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001703|Okay, all right, I was hardly able to keep myself together when that thing went down, I mean I had to see it.|Breaking and confessing in his enthusiasm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001701|Yeah, well, I might have an idea where it is...|Cautious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001700|Could you get hold of that Alb raider?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001699|If it is you'd better be fast? I've heard people are looking for that sucker.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001698|Well, I don't know how you'll get your hands on one of them. Unless you're talking about the one that came down in Edan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001697|Yeah.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001696|Bigger? Well, the only thing that's bigger these days is an Alb raider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001695|I had something bigger than jetpacks in mind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001694|Fliers? You mean jet packs? What model are we talking about?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001693|What? Is that what you're talking about?|Not believing, then enthused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001692|How much experience do you have with fliers?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001691|Chances are I can fix it upside down while under fire in a combat zone, meaning it'll be a piece of cake to fix it here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001690|Chances are whatever it is I can sort it out for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001689|What I wouldn't give for a real challenge. A mech, a raider, anything with real technical expertise involved.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001688|What do you need fixing?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001687|What sort of things can you fix?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001686|So, if you want to have something repaired you will have to pay for it. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001685|The Hort's days are over, buddy. We are all real Free People out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001684|Yeah. Harley, Deputy foreman of the 4th work crew from the Hort of Ignadon. Or I was. Now, I'm senior foreman of the 'only fucking guy here'.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001683|You're a mechanic?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001682|That didn't seem right to me. So, when I heard rumors about Origin and the help it offered people, well I came here to find something that was actually worth fighting for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001681|We got no mercy from the Albs and we gave none back. And the people trapped between us...I don't know how they survived.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001680|And after it was done and all those bodies were piled up, we turned around and went straight back to the city and just left those people out here to fend for themselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001679|Then I got sent to the front during one of the Alb attacks that were happening back then. We were told we were going there to help the farmers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001678|Me? I used to be a guard in the Domed City.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001677|How did you end up here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001676|There's a waiting list and I've got a lot of shit to mend.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001675|Whatever you want fixing, stick it over there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001674|But, I suppose we'll find out when the next mutant attack comes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001673|We can do without arguments here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001672|Not bad for now. Keep it up. We can use every good fighter we can get.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001671|Who else have you found?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001670|Have you found anyone else?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001669|That's good for a start. Who else can you offer?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001668|Origin's defenses must hold.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001667|I just hope they can work together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001666|I mean, any more would be welcome, but you've taken the pressure off for us now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001665|Okay. I would say that's enough fighters to make our camp safe.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001664|And others say that she is an able warrior and an excellent war leader. She will be welcome here.|Relenting
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001663|Nasty? Some say she is the worst devil the desert ever created|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001662|An Alb drone? And you trust it not to go all end of days and start killing us? I hope you're right.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001661|Him? He looks like an Alb. Are you sure you want to vouch for him? Still...I suppose we can't be too picky can we?|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001660|A mage? Well, we could use a more of those around here.|Pleased
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001659|As if we didn't have enough crooks in camp already... So, just know you're responsible for him and anything he takes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001658|A Cleric? Well, we'll see if he's prepared to do the fighting himself, not just leave it to others.|Doubtful, Eckard fought for the Clerics in the past.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001657|Good, great. The Berserkers know how to defend themselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001656|Ray, an Outlaw, has agreed to help. He'll be useful, just don't leave anything shiny around when he's nearby.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001655|C.R.O.N.Y U4 is an Alb fighting drone. I've given him orders to help defend Origin.|C.R.O.N.Y  = crony
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001654|Arx is an experienced warrior. He will help to protect Origin. He'll be reluctant, but he'll do it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001653|Falk, a...Cleric has agreed to help me. He will stay to defend Origin when he's not with me.|... is a trailed thought as the player may or may not know Falk's true nature.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001652|I met Duras, a Berserker warrior, he's agreed to travel with me and will stay here in-between.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001651|Caja, a powerful Berserker mage, will be happy to help defend the camp.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001650|Nasty, an Outlaw, has agreed to help. She'll stay here when she's not with me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001649|That would make good our loses.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001648|At least three would help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001647|You will?|Still weighing the player up. Cautious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001646|Well, we can always do with more weapons. But, above all we need more people, experienced people to help defend this place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001645|No pay...no stay. Got it? So, you'd better get out of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001644|Then get out of our camp. We don't need deadweight here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001643|Thinking doesn't do me any good.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001642|I'll think about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001641|I'm not paying you shit...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001640|We all pay our share here. We all work for each other. Understand that and we won't have any more issues.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001639|Let's hope so.|An edge of scepticism.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001638|Hmm, maybe you aren't a spy after all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001637|Here, I hope this helps.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001636|A thousand shards should prove you're not all mouth. do it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001635|Otherwise, I might think you're not serious. Then you might need to leave.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001634|Everyone here pays their fair share, now it's your turn.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001633|All right then 'friend', if you're really friendly, then let's see you make a donation, a generous donation towards the camp's defenses.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001632|Not everyone's an enemy, you don't have to fight everyone out there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001631|All right. It will be good to have some more companions out here who understand what they are doing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001630|Okay then.|Still weighing the player up.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001629|If I find anyone I can trust I will send them here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001628|If you meet anyone out there you'd trust to watch your back, who'd fight alongside you, well, I guess you can tell them where we are and that they'd be welcome here in Origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001627|So, you want me to find people with combat skills for you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001626|Exactly. People you can rely on, loyal people you can trust. The farmers and refugees here, they do their best. But, we need some real fighters. People who've been out in the wilderness and survived.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001625|You really want to do that?|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001624|What can I do to help people here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001623|Easy to say. You'd better not try that shit again.|Angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001622|I want to start over. We got off on the wrong foot. Let's forget about the past, all right?|Calming
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001621|What else do you want here? Haven't you caused enough trouble?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001620|This isn't about me, this is about Origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001619|You want to do this again?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001618|You still won't get any information out of me. I won't betray my friends, asshole!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001616|Why are you still hanging around here? Go on, run!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001615|I'll show you, you fucking spy.|Angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001614|Oh yeah? You think?|Angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001613|I guess time will tell, won't it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001612|I understand.|plus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001611|Let's speak straight and keep things clear. I see you step out of order here, I will have you put down. I believe in these people and I don't know who you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001610|If I really wanted information I could beat it out of you.|Angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001609|So, that makes me wonder. If you're not here seeking refuge, what are you looking for?|Weighing up the player character
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001608|You, however, don't look like you need protection|Weighing up the player character
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001607|That way we won't have any trouble with each other, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001606|Well you'd better keep your weapons sheathed and your hands to yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001604|Sure. Right.|Suspicious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001603|I really am just making conversation.|Placating
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001602|But, don't go bothering him with small stuff. He has better things to do than waste his time on strays.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001601|He's the only one crazy enough to try and keep this place together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001600|That's Lloyd.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001599|Me, no?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001598|Who are you? Are you in charge here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001597|I'm just making conversation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001596|Why the interest in our defenses? Who sent you?|Suspicious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001595|Conversation? And it just happens to be about our defenses? Don't think you can get round me that easily, asshole.|Angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001594|And how is that job going?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001593|If you believe in a dream, you have to protect it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001592|I take care of Origin's defenses.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001591|What do you do here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001590|For me, it is my mission in life. Everyone looking for protection will find it here with us. That is my promise.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001589|For others it is a stronghold of freedom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001588|It's a refuge, the last refuge from the Alb Converters for many.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001587|What is this place?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001586|Who are you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001585|Another of them are you? You think you can wander in here and start asking questions and demanding things do you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001584|Hey, you! Where do think you're going?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001583|I will come with you, but that doesn't mean I trust you.|cold plus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001582|Trust is earned. That goes both ways. You'd better remember that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001581|Logical... right. Does that mean you're coming?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001580|I know joining a faction doesn't appeal to everyone. But, it gave me purpose.|Suspicious, fishing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001579|If you want to talk to him about it, he is up there in the camp.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001578|I never really understood what that means.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001577|He calls our little camp up here 'Origin'.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001576|Lloyd. He's the most experienced warrior amongst us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001575|Who is in charge here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001574|You want to help us, you go for it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001573|We've done what we can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001572|Your camp could use better defenses.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001571|Here. Take this for your help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001570|We could use people like you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001569|I am heading back into Origin. You can come with me, if you want.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001568|Shit. That's a load off. I didn't realize how tense I was, but...I can breathe again now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001567|All the ones I could find.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001566|What? All of them? They are all gone?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001565|The mutants are dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001564|So, are you up for that? Luring the mutants here one-by-one?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001563|No, no. Either we do it how I suggested, or we forget it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001562|If those mutants attack, I'm the only thing between them and the others. So, if I go out there, those mutants could creep in while I'm gone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001561|My job is to protect the camp.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001560|I told you, I can't leave here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001559|That's what I thought. Talk big but then back out of it, hey. All chat and no action?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001558|Either you come with me, or you can forget it.|Minus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001557|You just want to minimize the risk to you.|plus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001556|How about you go and I wait here?|plus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001555|If you lure them to me here one by one, we can take them out together, okay? That way I can stay on guard.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001554|But, hey, here's an idea.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001553|Yeah? That would be great. But, I can't leave Origin undefended.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001552|I could come with you and help with the mutants.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001551|And it's always a choice, stay here and defend Origin, or go out there and leave this place undefended. Leaving the camp doesn't sound right to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001550|I've killed seven, or eight, but there are still ten out there. There's always ten out there, they keep coming back.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001549|Why don't you just kill them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001548|They're out there, waiting in ambush somewhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001547|There are at least ten round here right now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001546|And, no matter how many of them you kill, they keep coming back.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001545|Yeah, but the ones here are right mean bastards.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001544|There are Mutants everywhere on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001543|What? Do you want me to build you a fence? Dig you a moat? Put out some nice shiny signs? It's restricted because I say it's restricted.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001542|Why is this area restricted?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001541|Good idea.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001540|Wow, relax, you're going to give yourself a heart attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001539|I'd head up into our camp, or better still, just get out of here if you don't want to end up as mutant food.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001538|There are mutants all over the place just....waiting for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001537|Did I say restricted? Man, I've been out here too long...I meant it's as dangerous as trying to hold a barbecue in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001536|Try giving me orders again and I'll tear you a new asshole.|humane, cold minus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001535|I am leaving.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001534|It doesn't look like a restricted area.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001533|This is a restricted area and you have no business here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001532|Hey, you! Where do you think you are going?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001531|Watch your back, man.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001530|Thanks for the good news... Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001529|And, there is no way back. If any still harbored that hope.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001528|Then the rumors about you are true.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001527|Elexetor Parsek is dead.|his only is triggered if he is dead by the hand of the player.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001526|You have used up the only chance you get with me. Make sure nothing like this ever happens again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001525|I can't prove it, but I won't forget what has happened.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001524|If you think I see Nezol's death and your meeting with him as a coincidence then you are mistaken.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001523|It speaks well that you did not.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001522|Anyone else in your situation would probably have killed them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001521|I also know what happened.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001520|Yes. Nezol and his men.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001519|I met some of your people in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001518|We are gathering all we can find.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001517|If you can get to meet Sestak, I am certain that he will speak with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001516|But, be careful if you plan to go there. The base has been attacked and the guards will find it hard to trust a new face.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001515|Our leader Sestak has established a base at the Converter in south Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001514|I did as you asked. So, will you tell me where your headquarters are?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001513|I need to trust you more than I do before I'd tell you that. You have to help us first.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001512|Where can I find your headquarters?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001511|After a while we began to run out of supplies, including Elex. It wasn't long before we started to dream. To feel.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001510|You can't trust an Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001509|There was no way I was risking more Berserker lives to save some damned Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001508|That was probably the correct decision.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001507|There's no place for spies in Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001506|And, you're an Alb sympathizer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001505|You're a murderer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001504|You leave it to us to sort out your problems.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001503|Of course you don't. You outsiders never stand up for anything.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001502|I don't want trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001501|You have a problem with that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001500|The only good Alb is a dead Alb. And, they're the only ones you can trust.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001499|You had the Separatists killed instead of negotiating with them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001498|Separatists? Albs are Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001497|The Separatists don't want to fight you. You should talk to them. They're good fighters looking for allies to bring down the Elexetors. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001495|Then we are fortunate the Albs made the mistake of trying to kill you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001494|Perhaps, we can save more of our old comrades, by fighting against them instead of alongside them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001493|There's a whole squad. At least five of them. Can you handle that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001492|I'll find the Albs who are hunting you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001491|If you say so.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001490|Death, mortality, of the guilt that comes from remembering the things we've done. Some of us weren't born Albs, they are having it easier than those who were.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001489|We escaped and made it out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001488|We no longer wanted to be controlled by the Alb Directive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001487|The Albs are bringing about their own downfall. They're slaves with Elex there to control them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001486|We knew Parsek and the other Elexetors would see it as treason, but we had already seen too much without Elex to blind us...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001485|Well...loyalty should be rewarded.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001484|We defectors have to stick together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001483|Don't get caught... Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001482|And, I fear nothing I say will change his mind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001481|Hakon wants revenge for the deaths of his men.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001480|But... Why?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001479|But, he must do it soon. Xacor is preparing to move against us. Soon, the Elexetors may kill us for him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001478|It was a massacre in truth. One ordered by Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001477|For that, we will work with them to stop the rule of Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001476|The Clerics have fought wars with the Berserkers, but they still speak to them. Some of them must understand that we deserve a chance.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001475|To be treated like the other Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001474|What would you want in return?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001473|We fear that that could mean the downfall of us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001472|I still believe the Albs can become more than we are...But we can't do it alone and we can't save this planet by subjugating and killing everyone else.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001471|How did you escape from the other Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001470|We want to stop the Ice Palace from making a mistake.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001469|We want to be free from Elex, eventually.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001468|Yes, the Albs must be stopped.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001467|Even though the Elexetors want to kill you, you're still on their side? You mustn't want friends...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001466|So, it wasn't the Elex that made you that way. You really are an asshole...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001465|The Albs will conquer all and I will be there when they do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001464|They tried to kill me, I'm owed some revenge.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001463|But, does that mean you've joined the fight against Xacor?|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001462|It looks like you're no longer taking Elex.|Trying to believe it.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001460|You want to talk? Then, maybe you aren't still under the Elexetors' influence.|wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001459|I am here to ask you questions, not answer them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001458|No? Then why are you here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001457|I am not an enemy of the Separatists.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001456|You'd have shot me already if you thought I was an Alb. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001455|Or, has a near death experience brought you to your senses?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001454|So, are you still 'Commander' Jax? Alb servant of the Hybrid?|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001453|And, so you live.|Completing the statement
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001452|They tried. They failed.|Needs a rhythm to feed Nezol's response.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001451|Executed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001450|They said you were dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001449|Commander Jax?|Recognising the player character, hardly believing it
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001448|I value it.|Cool.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001447|Stop, not another step if you value your life.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001446|Those Albs weren't where you said they'd be.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001445|There's only one reason you'd lie. Time to face justice, you Alb spy!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001444|But. .. if they're telling the truth...|Relenting
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001443|Then, maybe, we Berserkers will have found the allies we need to defeat the Albs.|Relenting
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001442|I'll send a few men to these Separatists to see what their intentions really are.|Still unsure about the word 'separatist'. He doesn't believe Albs can change.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001441|Why don't you go back to your new friends? That way we can deal with you all together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001440|You're hiding those Albs and the only reason to do that is if you're bullshitting me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001439|You want me to trust you, but you won't trust me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001438|I'm not telling you.|Not wanting to get involved.  Humane cold minus two
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001436|Here, take this weapon, it seems you'll make good use of it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001435|Well, if they want to give up the fight then it is my job to give them a welcome. Tell me where you found them.|Cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001434|I found the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001433|The fewer Albs there are out here, the less they can tell their masters in Xacor.|Grudging respect
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001432|Whatever they're doing, those Albs have had a free run of things for too long. I need someone to head out there and kill them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001431|It could be they're searching for resources, but it could be they're scouting our patrol routes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001430|Straight to the point, good. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001429|This has nothing to do with me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001428|Tell me the mission.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001426|What about you? Are you ready to go and hunt some Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001425|I want to exterminate them. And every man, woman and child on this planet should want to do the same.|Calm, cold blooded
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001423|We ought to lock you up until we can ship you back where you came from.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001422|You want to kill Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001421|Sounds like you really hate the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001420|Can you think of one problem on Magalan that isn't down to outsiders?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001419|Escaping them, or spying for them? You should be fighting them. The only good Alb is a dead Alb.|Aggressive, in conversation camera
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001418|You have a problem with outsiders?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001417|I'm here escaping the Albs.|Calming the situation
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001416|Thank you for your visit to the Stargazer observatory.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001415|Follow all instructions from service personnel.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001414|Remain calm and proceed to the indicated exits immediately.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001413|Evacuation sequence initiated.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001412|Tell me your intentions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001411|We will only fight alongside you if you share our interests. The Hybrid goes. The old Directives must be restored.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001410|Will you admit that he seeks to control the destiny of the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001409|But, what are your intentions for the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001408|Xacor's exploitation of them must be stopped once and for all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001407|Ending this war is in everyone's best interest.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001406|This is not about sides.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001405|Our people stand on the edge of destruction and only we can prevent it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001404|The Albs and our cause must survive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001403|I am on the side of the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001402|The Elexetors are our common enemy. That should be enough.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001401|Are you fighting against the Hybrid, or are you only motivated by your need to revenge yourself against the Elexetors?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001400|Which side are you fighting for?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001399|What do you mean?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001398|But, I am still to understand your intentions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001397|Then we will fight you with everything we have.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001396|I told you that all must comply with the Hybrid's will, that includes you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001395|We cannot take that risk.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001394|You have fallen for the lies of the Hybrid and you would have us follow you back into the madness.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001393|You still don't get it, do you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001392|We should reason with the Hybrid, I'm sure he can teach us much.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001391|The Hybrid's rule must end. There is no other way to finish this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001390|So, tell me what you are thinking.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001389|That all depends on your intentions for the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001388|Do you want to fight in Xacor, or fight me here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001387|Then we stand with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001386|You have achieved much.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001385|Yes, but mine is clear. As are the results of my actions. You cannot say the same of others.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001384|As do you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001383|Never forget that all the Free People have their own agendas.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001382|The Berserkers have their own plans for Magalan, their goals will always be a threat to ours.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001381|Offer people power and they will take it. That includes the Pilgrim.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001380|I don't think Thorald has any interest in taking the throne in the Ice Palace. He's seeking to defend Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001379|Then there is another who will fight to take control of Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001378|The Pilgrim, Thorald, is key to the fight against the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001377|Victory will be ours.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001376|We will meet again in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001375|I will order final preparations to begin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001374|I am ready to attack the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001373|I think we will need to watch Zardom carefully.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001372|Whatever he says about his motives, I find it hard to believe that he has turned his back on his past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001371|The question is what he intends to do with them. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001370|I knew he must have a plan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001369|I have discovered Zardom's secret. He has control of a mutant force.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001368|I will continue to keep him under observation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001367|In any case, you shouldn't underestimate him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001366|He said little about that, so I'm not sure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001365|Does Zardom still have his Elex powers?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001364|You should be prepared to go your own way should the time come when your paths separate.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001363|Then you have moved in the right direction. But, you should question his path and your own.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001362|Zardom has recruited me to help his campaign against the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001361|I need more technical knowledge. Maybe there's a technician with the Separatists.|To himself
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001360|I don't have the technical skills for this.|Considering - to himself
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001359|There are those who saw your downfall coming. They were proved right.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001358|I'm not dying until I've had answers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001357|What is dead should stay dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001356|It will not come to that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001355|What will Kallax say when I report to him that I have corrected his failure of your execution? Your brother will be done for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001354|Will you stand there and accept your fate, or will you fight for your life?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001353|So, how should we do this?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001352|And you just happened to get promoted? Should I think that's a coincidence?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001351|Keep telling yourself that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001350|I was the one who was betrayed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001349|I still can't understand why you betrayed the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001348|Loyalty counts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001347|And my 'death' helped you improve your position within the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001346|And now you are nothing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001345|Elexetor Repox, I assume. You were nothing more than an ammunition carrier when I was still Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001344|Commander Jax. You're still alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001343|So. Then the rumors are true.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001337|That from Mana Magalan will be reborn'.|Quoting from Amrek's rules
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001336|Religion? That is for the Clerics. I have no belief except that we should save our planet.|Informative, not dismissive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001335|I don't know, but we would have to get close to the Hybrid to be able to make him do that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001334|What effect do you think it would have on him if he was to consume it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001333|I want to know why the Hybrid fears transmuted Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001332|Then we will see how we can use that knowledge against the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001331|First we shall have to learn them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001330|What should I do once I know Thorald's plans?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001329|That is what we shall discover, Zardom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001328|Until you complete your tasks and the Hybrid is defeated, what do such questions matter?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001327|And you are wasting our time, Jax. What matters now is removing the Hybrid. All other questions can be answered after that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001326|You are avoiding the question.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001325|We will only know that in good time, when we see who survives the war to come.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001324|And, who will lead the Albs with the Hybrid and the Elexetors gone?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001323|If that is the only way to save our people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001322|So, you want the Elexetors dead too?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001321|Then they must pay the consequences for that decision.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001320|And, if they remain loyal to the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001319|The Elexetors are his disciples, once the Hybrid is gone we must see what the Elexetors do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001318|This is not just a war against the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001317|What is it that you want, Zardom? Do you want to lead the Albs when the Hybrid is defeated?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001316|You should face the Hybrid. It is time to finish this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001315|Focus on the task that you have been given.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001314|No. You have your job and I have mine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001313|Teach me how to control the mutants.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001312|I retained control of them when I left Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001311|They will obey me when the day comes to fight.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001310|I know where to find that Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001309|And I know how to command.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001308|As long as they get the Elex they crave then they will follow the orders sent to their chips.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001307|How did you get the mutants to follow you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001306|So, you see? I might not command my soldiers any longer, but I do have a force to be reckoned with. Now, you must play your part and discover the purpose of Thorald's research.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001305|Mutants, so that's your force?|Assessing, not negative.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001304|Mana, chems, exposure from food tainted by it. It stays with people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001303|Elex marks people.|Assessing the player character
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001302|Thorald, the Pilgrim. What is it he knows that the Hybrid wants kept hidden?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001301|I should find the enemy he feared the most. The one I was sent to find.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001300|But, he's right. While our paths are aligned, I should make use of that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001299|I wonder what other powers Zardom is hiding.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001298|I must learn more of the Hybrid's plans and if I can't do that from his allies...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001297|He has retained his power to control mutants. He can force these creatures to do his bidding.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001296|So, this is Zardom's army.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001295|Elex brings strength to those with the will to tame but makes a slave of all others.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001294|Mutants. All that remains of the creatures that once lived in the Old World.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001293|As you wish. You should know who you are dealing with.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001292|Where is your support? What are you doing to stop the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001291|You keep saying it all depends on me, but what about you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001290|If you want my help you must prove your side of things to me. I want to see this 'force' you are talking about.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001289|Good, but I get the feeling you have more to tell me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001288|Good, was there anything else to report?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001287|Good. Do you have anything else to tell me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001286|I will be here waiting for you once you have completed the tasks.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001285|You have made progress, but there are still things to be done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001284|Yes, that is the true will. The will of a leader.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001283|You are lost, Commander. You must find yourself again.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001282|But, words and deeds are separate. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001281|After the acts of slaughter the Albs have done to their people, why would they not take their revenge?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001280|Then you really have spent too much time among the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001279|No, we cannot allow that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001278|The Berserkers would never commit genocide.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001277|I would take the risk.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001276|Are you still to be convinced that Hybrid must be stopped?|Frustrated
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001275|He offered logical reason, leadership and power...his ability to see the future. When our people left the Clerics it was to reject religion, the Hybrid has filled the space left when we turned our back on Calaan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001274|What proof is needed to open you eyes to the danger of Xacor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001273|If the Hybrid is so dangerous, how did he end up in charge of the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001272|Perhaps the Hybrid is right that the Free People are the true threat.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001270|We shall see.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001269|That is interesting. Then perhaps we can determine why the Pilgrim is perceived to be such a threat.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001268|I've found the Pilgrim's location.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001267|The fate of us all depends on it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001266|You must finish your old mission and secure Thorald's knowledge.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001265|The Ice Palace would fall and the Albs would be exterminated. We cannot allow that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001264|It's easy to imagine what they would do with our people then.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001263|It would destroy his plans and it would empower the Berserkers. While the Albs lose power, they would gain.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001262|The Hybrid could never allow that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001261|Imagine the effect on him if the Berserkers were to take huge quantities of it, turning it into Mana before he can consume it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001260|And, if he can achieve that, then the Hybrid risks losing vast amounts of Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001259|Yes, and after all, the Hybrid is demanding all the Elex in Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001258|I think that Thorald is seeking a way to change Elex without the need to take it to that shrine in Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001257|His knowledge could mean victory, or defeat in this war.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001256|Whatever the future holds, I am certain that Thorald is the key.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001255|He still hasn't found the Pilgrim even though he seems to feel that the Berserkers transmuting Elex is the biggest threat to Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001254|And it seems that the Hybrid has not succeeded in completing this mission since then.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001253|I didn't complete my mission, I was shot down before I could reach the Pilgrim.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001252|He tasked you with finding the Pilgrim, Thorald, did you learn anything that could explain the Hybrid's fear?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001251|I was hoping you could tell me, Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001250|Do you have any idea why he feared them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001249|He used to be preoccupied by the mages in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001248|But, the Hybrid must have realized by now that there is a new threat that he must consider.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001246|You have assisted our cause greatly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001245|You have done good work, Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001244|Then perhaps your secret can be kept a little longer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001243|The Elexetor Repox is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001242|Good, then we have one less threat to worry about.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001241|Yes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001240|Developed' does that mean the danger is now gone?|Picking up on the past tense.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001239|He developed it with a Cleric prisoner with the aim of attacking the Hort in Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001238|The Duke of Tavar's bomb was really a fighting machine.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001237|Well, that was faster than I expected. No doubt, the Ice Palace will be considering their response.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001236|The Converter in northern Abessa has been deactivated.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001235|Good, that was vital. We could not afford a shift of power in Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001234|The Alb force in northern Abessa has been defeated.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001233|And as Berserker living beyond the borders of Edan, she might have a more open ear than those living under Berserker law every day.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001232|We will need to call upon you when we face the Elexetors.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001231|The Berserker mage, Caja, will help us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001230|If we are to face the Elexetors, we would benefit from some magical power to assist us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001229|Then I advise you to try.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001228|No, not yet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001227|Good. And, were you able to win her over to our cause?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001226|Her name is Caja.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001225|I have recruited a powerful mage from amongst the Berserkers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001224|And, now you have won that group over, perhaps others will follow.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001223|The Free People are strong when they are well led.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001222|Then you can see the value of my advice, that place makes an excellent base for you doesn't it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001221|I have taken command of Origin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001220|Make your preparations. Meet me here again later.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001219|I will see you back here once you have completed your tasks.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001218|I want a better of idea of what is happening in the Ice Palace and the readiness of its defense systems.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001217|For my part, I will order my forces to infiltrate Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001216|Do that and I will tell you how you can lure Kallax to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001215|But, I'm not without power. I do have a force that is loyal to me. I have the strength to return to Xacor to strike at the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001214|I have told you my aims. I have told you that I have the resources to achieve them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001213|There is no way to free all Albs, but with the blood of those who serve the Hybrid, those lives will save others.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001212|This force must be stopped. Otherwise, they will tip the balance of power in Abessa in favor of the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001210|But, you will need to decide who you will back soon. The Hybrid has sent a force of combat mechs and soldiers to advance inland into northern Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001209|It is a sacrifice that it is painful to all. But, the Hybrid has blinded many of our brothers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001208|You claim you are doing this for the Albs, but then you're prepared to kill them for your own cause?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001207|Then help me achieve the things I need to turn the balance of power back in our favor. Help me shut down those Converters and make the preparations you need to.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001206|You will have my support, but you will have to deliver Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001205|When fate brings us together, we will see.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001204|He's my brother, we fought side-by-side our whole lives. He has to listen to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001203|I won't rest until he's lying dead before me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001202|Yes. And, you know I am your best option. I recommend that you take my offer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001201|You think you can do that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001200|Well, maybe I can help you, Jax.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001199|I will find a way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001198|Support me in my cause and I will make sure that you reach Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001197|He won't get the chance.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001196|And, how will you get close enough to speak to him? He is protected by a whole unit of soldiers and combat mechs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001195|He will kill you the first chance he gets.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001194|I want the person who got me into this situation. I want Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001193|And, it is time for you to tell me your plans. What is it that you want?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001192|Now you know my thoughts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001191|And who should rule the Albs? You?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001190|The Hybrid's last orders to you to were to kill Thorald the Pilgrim, leader of the Berserkers, yes? But, did he tell you why he ordered that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001189|You're saying a lot, Zardom, but where is your proof?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001188|This is just the speculation of an outcast, of a frustrated old man.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001187|Ruin? Why not victory?|Straight question
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001186|But, I know, I know that once he is done with the rest of this world the Hybrid will extract the remaining Elex from us. We will feed his evolution.|Shock moment
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001185|That it has a different goal for the Directive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001184|So, you think the Hybrid is lying?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001183|I don't question his goal. I question our place in it. Do you believe that when the Hybrid evolves the Albs will serve at his side? After it has kept the truth and power for so long that its drive for Elex will just stop?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001182|But, what will be left of our world at the end this war for Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001181|He says he must reach the peak of evolution perfection to secure the future of our people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001180|The First Elexetor Tarek is too blinded by the Hybrid's promises to see that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001179|No, Jax. After we have exploited the lands of the Free People, the Hybrid will only have one source of Elex left. Us.|Shock moment - reveal! :)
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001178|But, do you think that the Hybrid will ever be satisfied? What will happen when it has consumed all the Elex on Magalan? What then, Jax?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001177|All Elex means exactly that, all the Elex on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001176|You know the Directive requires all Elex must be delivered to the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001175|While First Elexetor Tarek follows blindly, I want answers, but I tell you the Hybrid won't give them to you. He only wants power for himself and it will be the ruin of our people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001174|What is it we've fought for Zardom? Don't you at least want to know that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001173|But, none have given me answers. None have said what the Hybrid's plan is, or how they think they can better it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001172|It seems many in Xacor are beginning to question the Hybrid's rule.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001171|Don't pretend you want peace, Zardom. That I won't believe.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001170|Challenge? You say that as it if it is unthinkable for an Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001169|If the Elexetors were to discover that you live then they would concentrate their powers against you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001168|But, he only has suspicions that you survived. He has no proof for now. I would suggest you take care of him before he learns you really are alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001167|You've hardly been discreet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001166|How do you know that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001165|I think he has picked up your tracks.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001164|And, you should know that an Elexetor has been seen near the Domed City.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001163|No, not at present.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001162|Do you think you have the strength to fight an Elexetor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001161|The question is whether, or not we can survive until we are strong enough to be able to defend ourselves.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001160|Sooner, or later the Elexetors track down every Alb outcast.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001159|Or, how an Outlaw has put together the technology capable of this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001158|What we don't know is his target.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001157|I heard that the Duke of Tavar is constructing a bomb that is so destructive it could destroy a city.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001156|Each of the factions has their own motives which could prove dangerous to our people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001155|Our cause in defeating the Hybrid matches theirs, but I will do nothing to endanger the future of the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001154|If we could shut it down, that would show the Albs the limits of the Hybrid's power. It would give us a chance to persuade others of our cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001153|The Converter in northern Abessa is strategically important.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001152|That is the only thing that would drive the Hybrid's soldiers from the Ice Palace is to stop the flow of Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001151|I heard of a mage in the Domed City with the power to fight an Elexetor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001150|Some of them are very effective. Their Mana has allowed the magic of Edan to evolve a lot of power.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001149|Is Berserker magic as strong as the Albs' magic?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001148|If you are looking for magic outside Xacor then you will have to look to the Berserkers of Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001147|But, I have only enough to reduce the impact of withdrawal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001146|Yes, I continue to consume Elex, pure Elex.|Admission
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001145|If you think I can acquire enough Elex to maintain my old strength, you are mistaken.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001144|They are a force waiting for a leader. You should seek them out. Perhaps there you can find what I have, a base of operations. Perhaps then you will see what I mean more clearly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001143|The people there are independent and fight for their own cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001142|If you will play your part in the struggle that is to come then I will tell you this, there is a camp in the mountains between Edan, Abessa and Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001141|If it isn't in Xacor then where are these soldiers?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001140|For now, I will concentrate on building resources here in the lands of the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001139|None. My soldiers stayed in Xacor. Such is the power of Elex. Such is the power of the Hybrid. It takes those with will to see the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001138|You were revered in the Ice Palace, how many Albs still follow you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001137|What if the Elexetors in Xacor learn of your plans?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001136|Are you allied with the Free People?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001135|How do you plan to attack Xacor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001134|So, will you admit that you have kept the powers Elex gives you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001133|If you want war then where is your army?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001132|So, you do want to challenge the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001131|We all must find our own path as this world changes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001130|And, what is it that you want, Jax?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001129|You didn't stop consuming Elex when you left Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001128|You found yourself a source somewhere and you have kept your strength. You can still cast magic.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001127|And how am I supposed to wage war? One Alb against Xacor? All I would gain is my own death. I have my new life here, that is what matters now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001126|His arguments were logical.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001125|It doesn't matter what I think. Logic tells me he is correct.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001124|He didn't give me reason to doubt his words. I trust him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001123|I'm not the one pretending to be something I'm not, Commander.|Calm Loading commander to remind the player character of his past.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001122|What are you really doing out here, Zardom?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001121|We both know the truth, Zardom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001120|You speak of Elex withdrawal and the doubt that plagues you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001119|So, drop the lie.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001118|But, none of that fits your appearance, your confidence or your character.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001117|It's obvious that you are hiding something. You are more powerful than you appear.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001116|And you believe Sestak?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001115|The Separatist leader Sestak told me. So, what is it that you want? Are you are planning war against the Hybrid?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001114|What makes you believe that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001113|You want to take power in the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001112|You can't deceive me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001111|I already told you, I have left that past behind me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001110|Tell me more about your past at the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001109|If you need something from me later, then you know where to find me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001108|Go and find your way through the wilderness out there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001107|I have told you what I will. You know what you must do.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001106|They fear you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001105|They judge you for your deeds as an Elexetor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001104|I want to live in peace here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001103|Yes. As I said, it was difficult at the beginning, there were some who recognized me. But, I have kept my identity from most.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001102|With some.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001101|You cooperate with the Free People?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001100|But, I put myself into exile so that I wouldn't have to discuss such things.|Stopping himself from going further.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001099|Maybe one day the time to speak will come, but that is not today.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001098|I have found my place out here and I will keep my peace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001097|You must see the Directive with different eyes now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001096|You have spent enough time away from Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001095|And, what is the bigger picture?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001094|He cannot see the bigger picture clearly any more.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001093|His mind is clouded.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001092|Tarek, the First Elexetor, is following a course with the other Elexetors that I cannot.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001091|You were an Elexetor, the highest rank and honor amongst our people and yet you left Xacor? Why?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001090|Why were you exiled?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001089|Maybe you should look for them at their base near the Converter in South Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001088|They must have the knowledge, plans and perhaps even the access codes for the Converters.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001087|However, there are technicians amongst the Separatists.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001086|I was an Elexetor, not a technician. I don't know the technical details of those machines.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001085|How can I deactivate a Converter?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001084|But, none of that is helpful as long as enough Elex is still reaching the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001083|Some Converters have maintenance issues or have been shut down, like the one in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001082|Losses have been high and the Free People have become more organized, at least within their factions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001081|But, the influence of the Albs is not as strong as it once was in the lands of the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001080|I would expect so.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001079|The Converters are heavily guarded.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001078|That makes sense.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001077|And the only way I can think of to stop the flow of Elex into the Ice Palace is to destroy, or deactivate the Converters.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001076|Elex must continue to be extracted.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001075|The security of the Ice Palace matters greatly to the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001074|They will only leave their fortifications in great numbers if something interferes with the Directive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001073|The Directive. Their great plan and the highest goal of all Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001072|What would make the troops leave Xacor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001071|But, then you know that better than I do, Commander.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001070|Soldiers who are sent into the lands of the Free People rarely carry the codes to the inner areas of the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001069|That is our way. Determined and logical.|Agreeing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001068|However, the fact remains that you will need to lure soldiers from their positions in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001067|That should be the last of your worries. You have other things to achieve first.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001066|Are we now supposed to despise where we came from, just because circumstances have altered? There have been changes in Xacor, but that should not eclipse its achievements.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001065|Feelings and remorse are irrelevant. They are soldiers, if they die they die doing their duty.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001064|I will have to find another way to get the codes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001063|So, what if Albs die? I will just have to fight.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001062|How will you get the access codes without fighting our own people?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001061|From who? Any Alb who identifies you as a renegade will attack you immediately.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001060|Then I will give you the access codes.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001059|The automated defenses will kill you before you get close.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001058|Without the correct codes, you won't get past the first defensive wall.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001057|You know unauthorized access to the Palace is impossible.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001056|Help me reach the Ice Palace.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001055|You think the Separatists will help you fight the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001054|Aren't you? They kill most people on sight, the lucky ones. If you're unlucky you'll end up a slave, or stripped down for Elex inside one of their Converters. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001053|Hah, you're scared of the Albs?|Defensive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001052|A job? Is that what I am?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001051|So, you believe they will help me? Despite who I am?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001050|The fact you are no stranger to them means that they will listen to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001049|Separatists? Why would they help me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001048|And, if you can convince them that you share their cause then they will help you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001047|They can be found in their base at the southern Converter in Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001046|They might be opposed to the new Directive, but they are strong and well equipped. You may find that you and they have things in common.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001045|I would advise that you speak to the Separatists.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001044|You will need to spend your time and your strength wisely.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001043|Elex withdrawal has made both of us weak.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001042|I need weapons and a way to improve my fighting strength.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001041|My raider was shot down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001040|And, what exactly is it that you think I can do?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001039|Then tell me about your situation.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001038|I don't have any reason to trust you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001037|You want my help with that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001035|We need to trust each other.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001034|We are both renegades now. Cast out and hunted by our own people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001033|Perhaps. |Neutral, unconvinced..
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001032|But, I stil live. And, I am searching for the truth of what happened to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001031|Kallax declared that I had failed my mission for the Directive and so must be executed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001030|I hope you can help me discover what that truth is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001029|Don't pretend you care for my wellbeing, Zardom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001028|Don't worry about me, I can handle this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001027|It is nothing I can't control.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001026|Has the transition to emotion, to free thinking unsettled the great Commander Jax?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001025|But, you...Commander. Your appearance tells me it is not going well for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001024|Out of Xacor. Separated from the Elex that gave you your powers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001023|Despite the withdrawal, Jax. I am all that I was.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001022|I spent many weeks in fever, haunted by visions as the Elex that had sustained me slowly drained away.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001021|But, in the end, I have been able to find a way to live with it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001020|And, now here you are.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001019|Zardom... Once trusted advisor to the First Elexetor.|Recognising him
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001018|Even great men fall when the power of Elex is taken from them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001017|Choose your next step carefully.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001016|Transmute, we transmute Elex.|Correcting
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001015|I'll get you a drink at the Fort, yeah? What do you say?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001013|Give you the...why should I give you the Elex?|Beginning to fall under the player's control. Fighting it, but confused, weakening
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001012|You should end his suffering.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001011|You're Kral, the guard from the Mana shrine, right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001010|As Amrek said, 'Our hope for Magalan is that all Elex shall become Mana'.|Quoting from Amrek's rules
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001009|Very well. You will find the Mausoleum in the area outside goliath that is down below the Pit, south, south east towards the World Heart.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001008|I'll go. If you tell me where it is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001007|Good, I appreciate your help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001006|Why should I help you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001005|What do you need?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001004|So, how do you transform Elex?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00001002|Something brought you here didn't it? You were drawn to this place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000998|It sounds like you're doing good work.|Minus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000996|Don't try selling religion.|plus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000995|Until then, we must contend with the danger here. The power released from Elex can make the Shrine a hazardous place. Please, be careful here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000994|One day, all Elex will come here and Magalan will be free from its influence.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000993|This is the Mana shrine, where Elex is turned from poison to nectar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000992|Have you been sent here with a task?|Jovial
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000991|Welcome to the Mana shrine.|Jovial
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000990|We found protection and a future for our kind in the ruins of the Old World.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000989|He came to us a stranger. Now, he stands in our midst, having earned the right to become one of us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000988|But, none of us can achieve this alone. None can stand alone. We must stand together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000987|With our magic we have held back those who see our future as one dominated by machines.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000986|From desert. From dead rock. We have brought back life.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000985|From here we have regrown a world that came before even that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000984|It has been many years since the first Berserkers settled in this place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000983|Return to me when you are ready.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000982|Very well.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000981|I would like to think about it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000980|Then so shall it be. With honor, with faith, with hope. You tie your blood to the soils of Magalan our mother planet and pledge to rebuild her as she was.|Solemn
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000979|I am ready to make my pledge.|Certain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000978|And we welcome you to our number.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000977|We are the fellowship of magic and of warriors.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000976|The Law of the Berserkers will guide him from this day.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000975|The time has come to accept another member into our community.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000974|We have stood against the forces of Xacor. We have struck down the Converter they built on our land.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000973|There's a group of Alb Separatists to the north. They continue their love of Elex machines, but they are fighting their own kind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000972|But, who knows where and when they will strike next, here, or in Tavar, or Ignadon.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000971|The war has hurt them, no doubt. Even their own kind has rebelled.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000970|Since then they have raided rather than trying to hold ground in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000969|You'll find the metallic ruins of it there and the soil around that monstrosity holds the bones of the Albs that came with it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000968|Then they sent a party to construct a Converter in the north of Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000967|Our war? This isn't a war of our choosing. They attacked us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000966|How is your war against the Albs going?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000965|Hey, just relax there, okay? We can talk everything over calmly without the need for accusations.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000963|Where are the things you stole from me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000962|Do you have anything else to report?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000961|In your time as Commander, you proved that effective action could be taken without needing large numbers of troops. That was important to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000960|In fact, by watching him kill me, you can assess his powers?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000959|He has shown no interest in joining us, perhaps he will talk to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000958|Not if he can still be useful to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000957|Every Elexetor deserves nothing but death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000956|His loyalty is only to himself. You will see that in time.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000955|An Elexetor would never betray his own.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000954|Perhaps, or perhaps you have yet to ask him the right questions. Zardom never did answer questions directly. I never understood how he rose so far in the ranks.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000953|I don't think he can help me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000952|I have already spoken with Zardom.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000951|I must find Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000950|Am I still part of his plan? Or did he send me to die at the hands of my brother? |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000949|Before the crash, I saw everything clearly. The Hybrid's will answered everything. Now, I have only one route to answers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000948|The Hybrid's will commands.|Repeating the mantra of the Albs, but lacking conviction
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000947|All Elex must be given to the Hybrid. All loyalty, all duty must be to the Hybrid, for the Hybrid sees all.|Repeating the mantra of the Albs, but lacking conviction
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000946|And yet, here I am. Living, breathing, in contradiction of the Directive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000945|So, why has he permitted me to live?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000944|What is in the Hybrid's mind? Surely, the infallible must know of my survival?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000943|Zardom harks back to the days before the Hybrid took over. He believes the Albs will evolve, that they are superior. He fears the Hybrid has subverted those causes for his own ends.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000942|Your reputation will mean that he has to take notice of you. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000941|We suspect Zardom plans to end his exile and return to Xacor to lead the Albs. In his own way, he always was loyal to our people, but he doubts the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000940|Put yourself into Zardom's service. Tell him that you want to fight the Hybrid together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000939|Why should Zardom help me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000938|And, if he kills me, that won't be a great loss for you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000937|Zardom is an outcast like you, but we don't know whether he still possesses his Elex abilities.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000936|You will benefit from talking to him and we will know what we have to do if he should ever stand against us. It's mutually convenient.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000935|Maybe you can discover what powers he still has and how he intends to use them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000934|So, I am the bait?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000933|I don't know what he is. He was a loyal Elexetor and yet he has run from Xacor. That is why I sent you. Partly for your own business, but also to learn his intentions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000932|Why have you left a former Elexetor alive? If he hasn't joined you, couldn't he be a threat?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000931|As he too is now sought by the Hybrid, perhaps he will help you. You should find him and tell him your purpose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000930|I am sure he can advise you how to take on the Elexetors without fighting your way through an army to do it. Although you will have to decide whether he can be trusted.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000929|He has established a hidden base there while the Ice Palace is searching for him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000928|One of my agents has reported that the rebel Elexetor Zardom is hiding in northeastern Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000927|But, I can tell you how to get closer to achieving your goal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000926|You have done well, but you should be cautious in your plans. You are not strong enough to challenge an Elexetor like Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000925|That is as I expected.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000924|We can trade, or offer advice for now, but our forces must remain ready to fight Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000923|More than that I cannot offer you right now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000922|I will ensure that our soldiers do not cause you any problems unless you show signs of reverting to your old allegiance to Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000921|You know how to deactivate them and that each one shut down will weaken Xacor. We will prepare to hold their forces when they retaliate.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000920|I would say that, ending the flow of Elex into Xacor would be strategically beneficial, but you must decide that for yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000919|They are your business.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000918|What about the other Converters?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000917|We will prepare for the Ice Palace's attack.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000916|I would expect Xacor is already planning a response.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000915|That is a blow struck against the Hybrid. Whatever he needs the Elex for, you just cut off one of his major supplies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000913|What can you tell me about the defenses there?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000912|That is always located in the upper area of the extraction tower.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000911|Out intel is reporting that they have been replaced by combat mechs, drones and mutants.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000910|Many of the units stationed there have been rotated out in the last few weeks.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000909|You will need to access the Converter's control center.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000908|How do I get access to the Converter's central computer?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000907|The Converter in southern Abessa has been shut down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000906|But, the code has to be uploaded directly into the central computer of each Converter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000905|This is the control code that will stop the Elex extraction program, it will stop a Converter from operating.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000904|We will start with this one here in southern Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000903|And, it must be us who does it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000902|The Converters must be silenced.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000901|You should be part of this, Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000900|We must lead the process that stops the Elexetors.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000899|Yes, you're right. Let's destroy the Converters and weaken Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000898|Compromising the Directive will only make total war inevitable.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000897|That is madness. You aren't strong enough to fight Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000896|Our first step must be to shut down the Converters.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000895|How are you planning to weaken the Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000894|Our numbers are growing. And we have become very effective in the way we operate..|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000893|You don't have the numbers to stop either the Free People or the Elexetors.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000892|You have planned this well, I am impressed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000891|You really believe this raptor shit? You think that you can change things?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000890|As soon as one of the other factions could endanger our purpose we move to stop them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000889|We have our agents and scouts all over Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000888|Weakening the Albs means that the Free People will come to power.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000887|The Albs will be free to evolve again once the Elexetors have been removed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000886|With their synthetic implants and all the Elex they have taken, the Elexetors have lost the ability to see things clearly, the will of the Hybrid is all that they know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000885|You know better than I do what Elex can do and what risks it carries.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000884|That is what they say, but what do they use that Elex for? What were we working to achieve?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000883|The highest goal of the Directive is to deliver all Elex to Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000882|Don't mistake raw power for strength. It is our goal that will define victory.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000881|Your roots will always be a part of you. You cannot escape your past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000880|The strong will always win.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000879|I am no longer an Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000878|Then you will die.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000877|And, if I won't join you in your quest?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000876|To achieve the next step in evolution. The logic of this still holds. We must return to our true purpose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000875|We will bring all Albs back to the true purpose and meaning of the Directive. All Albs including you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000874|The Albs are about more than serving the Hybrid and his need to consume all Elex. We broke with the Clerics to follow logic instead of religion.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000873|You know the Albs in Xacor aren't free. They are blinded by the words of the Elexetors. Their minds are controlled by the Hybrid.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000872|We don't celebrate these deaths. They are sacrifices to a greater cause.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000871|We Separatists will see that influence broken. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000870|Though you aren't strong enough to face Kallax, you are ready for the next few steps you need to take.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000869|But, what you have achieved so far will not make you strong enough to challenge Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000868|Yes, you have done well. Your preparations should have made you ready to take the next step.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000867|The equipment I have found will have to do the job.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000865|Then it seems that your ties to Xacor are being cut. You will have to use the equipment you can get from the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000864|No, he had sold it on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000863|So, you have recovered your equipment?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000862|I found the thief who stole my armor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000861|Perhaps...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000860|But, perhaps these visions will help you to learn who you really are now that Xacor has lost its power over you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000859|They say that it was something similar that gave the Hybrid his first visions, but who knows. All there is around the Hybrid are stories, few facts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000858|I don't know for sure. There are many stories of Albs who have had visions as their bodies fought against Elex withdrawal. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000857|What is causing them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000856|Learned? Nothing. The visions have only given me more questions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000855|What have you learned from them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000854|I'm not sure, I think they were visions from my past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000853|What have you seen?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000852|That may be so for now, but do not dismiss them, it may be that they have answers to offer you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000851|The changes in me are having other effects. I am having visions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000850|I knew you would find the tools you needed to survive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000849|The equipment I have should be good enough to take on the Albs in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000848|The Clerics' technology is comparable to ours and they are fully committed to stopping Xacor's victory.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000847|The Outlaws have a good instinct for opportunity and an understanding of Old World technology that allows them to prosper.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000846|That connects them to us, but they fear the Albs since we split from them and that means they have no trust for Separatists.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000845|The Berserkers' rejection of technology is strange, but they have a vision for the future of Magalan, that gives them purpose.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000844|Then I hope this brings you strength.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000843|I have joined a faction.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000840|Try their outposts on the border of Edan and Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000839|I would look to the Outlaws of Tavar for the person responsible.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000838|It is doubtful that the Berserkers would have been so quick to take your equipment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000837|If I hadn't been robbed while I was unconscious in the mountains, I would have the equipment I need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000836|Whatever you do, you will need to improve the standard of your equipment if you are going to fight the Albs in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000835|Or search the ruins of the Old World.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000834|Try the cities of the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000833|Where can I go to improve my weapons and armor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000832|But, no faction will teach you their skills unless you can show that you agree with their way of life, that you are willing to join them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000831|If it is technology you seek, then that can only really be found in the hands of the Clerics.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000830|The Outlaws are experts with Old World projectile weapons. They have fewer rules and a freer life.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000829|The Berserkers are powerful mages. But, they use antiquated weapons and reject most technology.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000828|They each have their own strengths and abilities.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000827|Which faction do you think is most effective?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000826|No, not enough to risk the survival of my people on that trust.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000825|What you mean is you don't trust me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000824|Now you must do your part.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000823|And I am helping you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000822|Maybe that will change one day, but until then you must be satisfied with this alliance as it is.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000821|I came to enlist your help, not that of the Free People.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000820|I think your fate is now tied to theirs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000819|You must learn their skills and perfect them if you, or they are to survive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000818|And they are now your only chance of survival.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000817|The Free People face destruction at the hands of the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000816|You have changed, Jax, you must accept that change.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000815|You will have to find other ways to acquire strength. You cannot reverse that process now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000814|But, as the Elex has drained from you body, so has your power.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000813|Of course you do. You were once the most powerful field commander in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000812|In terms of our alliance.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000811|What else do you have to report?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000810|Do you have anything else to report?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000809|That is good progress but there are still some things to take care of. Come back when you have more to report.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000808|I will send the coordinates to your adjutor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000807|They are monitoring the Converter in Edan. Some day Xacor hopes to reclaim it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000806|That is true, but you have shown a measure of the skills that will be required if you are to achieve your goals.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000805|Killing those few soldiers took brute force. We will need a more strategic approach to deal with the forces in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000803|So I have heard. It seems you are willing to fight against Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000802|I have killed the Albs in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000801|But, whatever the facts, it is still too early for us to attack the Elexetors directly.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000800|You want our help. We want you to prove you share our interests. This will achieve both our aims.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000799|Meaning you want me to take care of your business?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000795|Believe me, I don't like the thought of killing Albs who have not had chance to think about the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000794|But, the troops in Edan are not only capable of reporting your presence, but ours too. They threaten our existence.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000793|I thought your fight was with the Elexetors, not the foot soldiers of Xacor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000791|What does it matter whether you're killing to fulfil the Directive, or to stop it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000790|How many deaths do you have on your hands? Why should it matter that they are Albs instead of the Free People?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000789|The more time that passes, the greater the risk that Xacor will learn of your survival. Your challenge will only become more difficult. You should get ready as soon as you can.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000788|I don't think I am strong enough to fight them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000787|Very well. Where can I find the Albs in Edan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000786|It is a logical step, but eliminating Alb soldiers will not be easy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000785|You want me to kill my old comrades?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000784|We have yet to hear any intel that indicates that they have learned of your survival.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000782|You should kill those Albs before they can tell anyone in Xacor that you still live.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000781|Your raider crashed in Edan if the Albs there find someone who has seen you alive then word of your survival may reach Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000780|You think Xacor doesn't know I'm alive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000779|I suggest you stop the Elexetors discovering your resurrection.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000778|And if they find you then they will kill you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000777|Revenge clouds the mind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000776|So, you deny that it is emotional. We will see.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000775|He wants me dead. Killing him is logical.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000774|And so what? That doesn't change the facts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000773|Your quest for revenge.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000772|Then we should fight him together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000771|They say he has taken your place and now leads the Alb armies into battle.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000770|That is true.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000769|That makes him the big threat to you Separatists.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000768|Kallax is the greatest threat left in Xacor after the Hybrid. His attempt to execute you, if that is what it was, shows he will stop at nothing to see the Hybrid's will is done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000767|It feels like an emotional need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000766|How do you justify targeting your fellow Albs?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000765|I will find Kallax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000764|I want to get my power back. The power I had as an Alb.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000763|You have lasted far longer than I could have imagined.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000762|Your survival, without Elex, away from Xacor, is remarkable.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000761|And why would you do that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000760|That makes me curious as to how you have you mastered the power of emotions and navigated the world of the Free People. It makes me wonder what you will do next.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000759|Speak then, Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000758|And, yet here you are alive. Hardly convincing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000757|If you think hollow threats will persuade me, you are mistaken.|unmoved
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000756|Kallax tried to execute me!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000755|Try anything and you will be the first to die.|Threatening
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000754|Your arguments have failed to persuade me.|Neutral
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000753|They know you as well as you know them, that could be a weakness and your knowledge of their orders is weeks old. It is useless.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000752|My experience as an Alb Commander can help you defeat the Albs sent after you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000751|You and your brother Kallax worked together to kill all who stood in the Hybrid's way. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000750|How can I believe you have rejected all that past loyalty?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000749|And you were their most faithful servant. You saw to it that the Hybrid's word stood above all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000748|Yes. Our struggle is not with the Alb people. Only with their leaders.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000747|The things the Albs stood for, the true vision of our people these things have been pushed aside since the Hybrid appointed the Elexetors.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000746|Someone from Xacor ordered my execution. Can't you see that our fight is aligned?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000745|You are fighting the Elexetors, they are my enemy too.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000744|Elex strengthens us physically and mentally while your emotions weaken you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000743|Even now you are taking on a fight only because of your addiction. Elex weakens you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000742|You are still tied to Xacor while you take Elex.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000741|You are dependent on Elex, I am not. You can learn from that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000740|But, I will give you the chance to prove your value where words have failed.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000739|Your narrow-mindedness is the reason you won't succeed. You're thinking like Albs, but you lack their strength.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000738|Withdrawing from Elex has left you emotional, Jax. That emotion only proves how worthless you would be as an ally.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000737|You're no longer an Alb. You are weak, Jax. Why would I ally myself with you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000736|The opportunity to let an enemy infiltrate our ranks?|Dismissive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000734|I will give you three chances to persuade us before we decide your fate.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000733|You idiots should talk before drawing your weapons.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000732|This is an opportunity, Sestak. We should work together.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000731|I should kill you here and now in case you decided to rediscover your loyalty to him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000730|You need me, Sestak, accept it. You have no choice but to work with me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000729|You would have done anything in his name.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000728|No, that's not enough. Nobody has forgotten your loyalty to the Hybrid.|Coming to a conclusion
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000727|Isn't the fact that they want us both dead enough reason for us to help each other out?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000726|The Albs from Xacor tried to kill me. What do they think of you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000725|It seems like we're on the same side, Sestak.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000724|And, why should we help you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000723|The enemy of my enemy is my friend?|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000722|I need your support.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000721|I heard you were dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000720|If someone had told me you would turn up here, I wouldn't have believed it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000719|Now, the great commander stands before me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000718|So, what can one Alb rebel do for another?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000717|Disgraced, but not dead. An exile.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000716|How times change.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000715|They tried to execute me, I got lucky.|Assessing the player character
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000714|Jax. Commander Jax.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000713|The survival of our people matters above all else.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000712|Good. I don't want to be recognized.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000709|Okay. Okay. I understand, but please...I gave you a chance. Can't you do the same for me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000708|Right....|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000701|Combat, magic, if those interest you then the Berserkers offer training to people who join their ranks. We'll make a warrior of you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000700|Hah, yes, well, I'll take that as a compliment. You won't regret it.|Amused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000697|Why are you interested in that, really?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000696|It's obvious that you've travelled through dangerous territory before.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000695|You're doing well.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000693|Follow me.|Disappointed
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000692|I want to go to Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000691|Say, you didn't see anyone else up there in the ruins did ya? You're the first person I've found this trip and it would save me a trip up there to check.|Change of tack to engage the player.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000688|Well, then you got really lucky. An Alb raider crashed a few days ago and their scouts came through looking for it. Trust me, you don't want to run into a party of Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000685|So... Make yourself useful in the city and we can talk about better armor for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000684|The Berserkers raised Edan from wasteland to forest. This is our home and we will hold it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000683|Don't go too far.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000682|A fish rots from the head down.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000681|At least you're observant.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000680|I have to admit I underestimated you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000679|Grrh... Is it that obvious that we have some problems here in Goliet?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000678|Let's assume I help you out ...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000677|Cormag, Angrim and myself will see the Berserkers stand firm. Talk to Angrim if you want to know more.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000676|But, the Berserkers' roots run deep into the ground here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000675|War takes its toll. The Clerics fought us, the Outlaws have raided us and now we must face the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000674|I heard you had taken heavy losses.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000673|Why not?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000672|You dont even the rank of a Cultivator, let alone that of a Warrior, and you want Warlord's armor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000671|Ha! You can't simply buy a Warlord's armor!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000670|Yes, correct. The quicker you understand that the better for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000669|Heed my advice and you will find the Berserkers to be good hosts.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000668|I think you understood me.|Wry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000667|No.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000666|Doesn't sound like I have a choice.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000665|Can you repeat that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000664|You're the boss.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000663|Is there anything else?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000662|Because if not, you will have to answer to me. Is that clear?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000661|I hope we understand one another.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000660|If you serve the community, you will receive fair compensation for it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000659|These rules are very simple: If you harm the Berserker community, you will pay.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000658|So, if you want to be tolerated here you must follow my rules.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000657|Everyone who wants to move freely in my city must contribute.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000656|Ah, so you're a seeker.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000655|I need information.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000654|Everyone who takes advantage of Goliet's protection must contribute.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000653|Well, Edan has become inhospitable in the last few months.|Working through the standard speech, conversational not a lecture.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000652|But this is not a refuge camp here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000651|I need your protection.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000650|There is more than enough work to go around.|All too aware that they need people
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000649|You can prove yourself by helping the people of Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000648|I am looking for work.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000647|Oh, believe me, you will. This is my city. And I don't recognize your face.|Unphased. Probing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000646|So either you are crazy, damn brave or simply foolish.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000645|Well, well, You have guts enough to simply stroll in here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000644|Again: What exactly do you want here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000643|Oh? Hopefully you have good news from the other lands, otherwise this will be a very short guest performance for you here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000642|Mh... Even if that is true, then you marched straight into the lion's den.|Setting out the rules of Goliet
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000641|Ha... You survived an Alb execution?|Assessing the player. Impressed by the honesty
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000640|My people tried to kill me and I am seeking refuge.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000639|So you had better think very carefully about your next answer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000638|I don't have to explain myself to you.|Hostile, suspicious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000637|I am nobody.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000636|I am actually not from Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000635|I am an Alb defector.|Honest
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000634|So, are you an emissary? Why are you here? Speak!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000633|Anyone who commits a crime must answer to me. Emissaries from the other communities also have to speak to me first.|Gruff humour
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000632|I am Warlord Ragnar, patron of this Berserker settlement while Master Thorald is on pilgrimage.|Gruff humour
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000631|Um... what?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000630|So. And what is your crime?|Businesslike, wanting to move thinks along quickly.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000629|I hope Askor can rest easier now death has taken his killer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000628|So, he escaped me, but didn't escape justice.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000627|Duras is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000626|Here, take this reward as thanks for ending this matter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000625|I am surprised you solved this before Duras.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000623|You did well to bring this information to me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000622|Duras will be brought to answer these accusations.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000621|No. No, I cannot believe that. An innocent man would have spoken out. His silence tells me the truth and justice must be done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000620|That Duras killed him in self-defense, but kept that from me, even when he was appointed to investigate the murder?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000619|And you expect me to believe this? |Angered
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000618|Duras killed him in self-defense.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000617|Askor decided that truth had to be kept secret. He attacked Duras.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000616|Duras discovered that Askor had killed the Seedling that Askor had in his care.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000615|Can you prove this accusation?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000614|Duras?|Shocked
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000612|He confessed to me. There's no doubt in my mind that he did it.|The player is lying to protect Duras.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000611|Then go quickly. That bastard doesn't deserve to walk free.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000610|With pleasure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000609|No, I have a better idea. You found the evidence to find him guilty, now you will punish him.|Stress on you
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000608|If he's confessed, he's confessed and our murderer is found. I will have him arrested immediately. Justice must be done.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000607|Barin? I only put him on the list because he was on duty outside Goliet, but...|Finding it hard to believe
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000606|Barin murdered Askor.|The player is lying to protect Duras.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000604|So, we have an answer. There would never be a good result to this tragedy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000603|I will consider this matter closed. My thanks to you and to Duras for bringing me this closure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000602|But, knowing that this foul murder was not committed by one of our brothers, is as much as I could hope for.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000601|You stand for the Law and you see good men die for it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000600|I had started to hear grumblings about Askor, but defending a Seedling to the death, that is the man that I knew.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000599|Askor refused to hand over the Seedling and was killed for it.|Lying to protect Duras
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000598|My guess it was a simple robbery.|Lying to protect Duras
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000597|So, why was Askor killed?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000596|For the Seedling.|Lying to protect Duras
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000595|None of the suspects had a clear motive, or opportunity. It makes sense that it was an outsider. There is a war on after all.|Lying to protect Duras
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000594|How do you know this?|Stern
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000592|So, Askor died honorably defending the Seedling?|Buying the lie
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000591|The murderer isn't anyone from Goliet|Lying to protect Duras
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000590|Duras is the murderer. He killed Askor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000589|Anything you know would be helpful. What have you learned?|Intrigued
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000588|I have some information about Askor's murder.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000587|Justice will be done.|Certain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000586|Askor's murderer must face the punishment they deserve.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000585|So, it was only right that his murder should be investigated by Duras.|He has faith in Duras
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000584|Yes. Askor was a trusted and well liked member of our people.|Solemn
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000583|You ordered the Warrior Duras to investigate Askor's murder?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000582|I'm saying nothing.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000581|Nothing. Nothing.|Denial then fear
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000580|What do you know about that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000579|There was a dead Seedling in the casket.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000578|Yeah, so? It's also the place exiles and criminals get sent. Any suspicious casket has nothing to do with me. I'm saying nothing.|Panicky
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000577|You told me that's your favorite place to go. Now, do you want to tell me you don't know anything about something hidden there?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000576|So? What's that got to do with me?|Shifty, nervous
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000575|I found a casket near the lift into the Valley of the Damned.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000574|You think? How am I going to sleep with all this talk of murder?|Grumbling
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000573|You can go back to sleep.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000572|The lift that leads to the Valley of the Damned. There's something about the sound of that big wheel, the waterfall, the view of the Valley, it's peaceful there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000571|Where did you say you go when you're not here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000570|You're as bad as Duras. And, I'm not going to end up like Askor!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000569|How about I kill you and take the shards?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000568|Yes, yes, of course. Of course. I'm going, but you're damning an innocent man. I mean, look at me? You think I could murder someone?!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000567|You had better not return to Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000566|Thank you, thank you. Here, take it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000565|Give me the money and get out of here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000564|Please, please, I don't want to die!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000563|I will give you everything I have. Here 350 shards.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000562|How much?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000561|It's the truth. Please, look at me, I have enough trouble getting up in the morning, I couldn't murder anyone. All right, all right, if the truth won't get me out of it will shards? I didn't do this!|Shocked, scared
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000560|You expect me to believe that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000559|What? No! I'm not the murderer! Duras killed Askor!|Shocked, scared
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000558|You've been found guilty of Askor's murder and will face justice.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000557|Warlord Ragnar sent me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000556|And what about Barin?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000555|Is that what you think?|Aggressive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000554|You missed your chance.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000553|I should have killed you in the mountains.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000552|Wait a moment...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000551|I could tell Ragnar that murderer wasn't a Berserker.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000550|Then do it, but quickly. The sooner we have it behind us the better.|resigned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000549|Then draw your weapon, or trust me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000548|You don't believe I can let you go to Ragnar after that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000547|You'll have to take that risk.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000546|You could also tell him it was me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000545|I solved the murder. I will get the reward.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000544|What do you mean?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000543|Time for you to step aside and let me finish this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000542|Ragnar wants answers. This won't be over until he's happy he has them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000541|And I can see you won't let me have the chance I need.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000540|No, that's...I tried to close the investigation to point suspicion outside Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000539|You'd've let them face exile instead of you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000538|Instead you let innocent men look guilty.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000537|And what about me? Barin and I both know the truth.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000536|You could have admitted what happened.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000535|You could have shown him the body.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000534|You could've taken him the Seedling.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000533|So, why not tell Ragnar what had happened?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000532|Askor was given a Seedling to look after as part of his test.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000531|The Laws forbid anyone from harming them on pain of death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000530|You wanted to hide the dead seedling from me, and Berserker Laws hold Seedlings as sacred.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000529|You now know who the murderer is. That is what you needed to discover.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000527|Property that belongs to the Berserkers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000526|What is in the casket?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000525|Aha. So, what happens now?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000524|I take this to Ragnar, he will deal with it from here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000523|I'll take it to Ragnar. And you can consider this case done. You needn't worry about it anymore.|Lying.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000522|After what you did for me, I will trust you to decide what to do with the casket.|Minus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000521|You got to the truth. For that, I thank you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000520|I'll take things from here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000519|I solved your case for you, Duras.|plus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000518|It could be. I'll take it now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000517|Is that the Seedling that disappeared on the night of the murder?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000516|I told you not to interfere with the evidence.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000515|This dead Seedling was in the casket.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000514|No, that was Askor's. And, now we find it at a place Barin confesses coming to regularly? I'd say we have some evidence.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000513|Here, do you think this could belong to Barin?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000512|What did you find?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000511|I found something hidden in Barin's hiding place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000510|So, why hide that and why frame Barin?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000509|Since when have criminals been clever? And Barin's not that smart, maybe he just let something slip?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000508|Why would Barin talk about that place if he had something to hide?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000507|What other leads do we have? Look, let's just check this out and then we'll know for sure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000506|Who knows, but we don't have any evidence so far, so it feels like we should check this clue out. At least so we can tell Ragnar that we did.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000505|Just trust me. Your life might depend on it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000503|No, I just...I'm warning you, do what I say.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000502|Then you know what it is?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000501|Bring anything you find to me without disturbing it. Whatever you find, we should take it to Ragnar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000500|What do you mean interfere?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000499|Have a look round, bring me anything you find. Just don't interfere with it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000498|We won't know until we find it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000497|What is it I'm looking for?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000496|Alright, I'll search the area near the lift that Barin talked about.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000495|You're serious? You really think Barin did it?|amazed humane, cold minus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000494|What do you think we'll find there?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000493|Then we should go there and see what we find. Do you want me to come with you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000492|I found him in the forest, but he said he takes time off to go to the lift into the Valley of the Damned.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000491|Do you know where Barin is?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000490|Ragnar wants answers, he's insisting the murderer is found. You've questioned everyone and Barin's the only one without a decent alibi.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000489|I thought you said Ragnar only included Barin in case he saw something?|Surprised at this new certainty
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000488|The others all have alibis and Barin knew Askor better than the others.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000487|Then it must be him.|Suddenly certain
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000486|There was no one there to say he was at his post. And, of all the suspects, he knew Askor the best.|Reluctant to agree
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000485|What about Barin, he didn't have a proper alibi did he?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000484|Then tell Ragnar that.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000483|I don't know.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000482|Then who do you think it was?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000480|Thank you. You don't know what a weight this has been...I owe the Berserkers, now I owe them more.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000479|I didn't want him dead, but he flipped on me. I don't think it helped that it was me. He couldn't stand the idea that he'd be facing exile while I continued on as a Warrior.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000478|Really? the word of one outsider against another. You think they'll believe you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000477|I need to think about it.|plus one cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000476|You're a murderer, I will make sure you face justice, you bastard!|Minus three cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000475|Barin's been blackmailing me. He found me with Askor's body. He knows I'm an outsider. Who would they believe? Who do you believe? I gave you a chance. Won't you do that for me?|Giving in, admission followed by an appeal
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000474|I can see why you did it. I'll keep your secret.|plus three cold
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000473|Kill him, yes. Murder him, no. I found Askor by the lift one day. He'd managed to kill the Seedling he'd been given. He knew that would stop him becoming a Paladin. He attacked me.|Starts as a denial, becomes a confession. He explains.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000472|So, you did kill him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000471|Ragnar will see me dead. I'm an outsider and Askor was born a Berserker. He was known and he was one of Ragnar's favorites.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000469|I do, it's simple: You murdered Askor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000468|And, you've spent all your time trying to persuade me not to investigate this.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000467|You spend your time outside Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000466|What are you talking about? You can't seriously think it was me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000465|Tell me your alibi.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000463|You can't think I did it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000459|Me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000458|There's just not the proof. There's only one person associated with Askor we've not investigated. You.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000457|Well, I don't think any of the people on the list did it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000456|Very well, what do you think?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000455|You want to know what I think about the murder?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000454|The destruction of a Seedling is a matter for a Warlord. Your involvement is over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000453|Is that everything you have to say?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000452|My duties keep me here most of the time. So, I stay, looking after my girls, the trees. Making sure they stay safe.|Sensing the player character wants more information
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000451|Maybe I could use it. This place will come in handy.|Noting to himself.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000450|Looks like someone's used this as a camp before now.|Observing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000449|Trying to manage an outpost with too few people and too few supplies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000448|Just over three months. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000447|Not long before I came out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000446|Just over 3 months ago.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000445|When did you last see Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000444|Not good enough to hit someone in Edan from here if that's what you mean.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000443|You must be good with a sword to have got posted out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000442|This camp by the World Heart is where I've been and this is where I will stay until the Warlords order me back.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000441|Yes, more if we find that missing supply team.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000440|And you have witnesses to your whereabouts?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000438|Since then I've been out here. Trying to survive in the beautiful highlands of Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000437|How long have you been away from Goliet?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000436|But, he stayed back in Goliet so he could take the Warrior test.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000435|Yeah, I asked if he could come out here on this assignment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000434|You knew Askor well?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000433|So, what do you think got him murdered?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000431|I don't know. Askor was a good man, well, he was to me, but he could wind people up. Maybe, he got the wrong person pissed with him. Maybe, someone else was as ambitious as him.|Thinking it through
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000430|Passing that test was all he ever wanted.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000428|Last I heard he was due to be tested by Ragnar, along with some other candidates.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000427|Me? No, well, not specifically. He's ambitious. Was ambitious. He always wanted to become a Paladin.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000426|Look into whoever might have been a rival for Askor. That's my advice.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000425|I am working on it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000424|Duras? Well, he's a man who stands by his duty. I hope the two of you find the murderer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000423|Yes. Duras told me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000422|He said to question me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000421|Yeah, well, I hope you find who did.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000420|I think Ragnar must just have wanted you eliminated from suspicion.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000419|It's obvious you didn't do it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000418|You've explained enough.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000417|Can you think of anyone who might have done it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000416|Damn. I knew it. He was just too ambitious.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000415|He was murdered.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000414|What the hell happened to him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000413|Dead?|Shocked
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000412|Askor is dead.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000411|Yes, my name is Thorgal.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000410|Just stay clear of the World Heart while you're here. Then we'll get along fine, there won't be any shit, okay?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000409|Are you a sentry here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000408|You've done well getting here alive.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000407|A sword. I hate it. That's another reason I want to join the Outlaws. I've got myself a gun, but I want some real weapons.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000406|What weapon do you use?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000405|I just did what ever they said. I didn't want to be exiled to the Valley.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000404|Sometimes I was digging shit alone. Sometimes finding supplies alone. Sometimes marching round and building stuff where they told me to, those days I was with people.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000403|I don't know. I didn't keep a diary. Depends on the day and the orders.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000402|Do you have proof of where you were three months ago?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000401|It's his sort that makes me want to say this...fuck the Berserkers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000400|Yes. He was an arrogant asshole. He'd've done anything for promotion.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000399|Did you know Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000398|Wait, you don't think I was involved do you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000397|Once I had the supplies I came straight out to Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000396|Askor could. That guy wanted to do everything to get promoted. He hated anyone else who could read. Especially if they weren't born in Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000395|You can't exactly climb the career ladder if you can't read.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000394|Man, I would have to be able to read first.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000393|You don't seem happy as a Cultivator, did you ever think of seeking promotion?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000392|I've not been close to Goliet for a year. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000391|No, I was out in the forest gathering supplies before I travelled out to the World Heart.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000390|Were you close to Goliet three months ago?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000389|As you say.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000388|No way, I wouldn't have risked that. Even though he was an asshole.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000387|Shit, what? You thought I did that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000386|I don't think you killed Askor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000385|Okay, I've heard enough.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000384|I've done nothing but work, follow orders, dig shit and for what? To have people try and kill me for things I don't even believe in. Fuck them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000383|How did that happen?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000382|Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000381|The Berserker Askor has been murdered.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000379|I want to see the world!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000378|Yes, absolutely. They know how to live freely.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000377|Instead, I am stuck here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000376|You want to be an Outlaw?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000375|The Outlaws in the desert are the only truth - freedom, profit, no bullshit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000374|Fuck rules, fuck laws, fuck the Berserkers!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000373|It's all laws, commandments, rules, it's bullshit, all of it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000372|Berserkers, Clerics. Fuck them all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000371|I am sick of the shit here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000370|Why are you interested in Tavar?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000368|No. I am talking about the real south. The deserts of Tavar|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000367|You mean Edan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000366|Hey, you. What's new from the south?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000365|Of course, it's dangerous out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000364|Do you carry a sword?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000363|Yeah, I guess we're not a priority.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000362|But, since the Albs started attacking we've been left on our own out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000361|It didn't used to be as lonely. They'd send patrols out to check on us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000360|Most of the time. That's part of the punishment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000359|You work here on your own?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000358|But, it never arrived.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000357|It heard it was being sent to a Cultivator in the hope it could go on to Tavar, or somewhere as a new World Heart.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000356|No one seems to be asking about it, and from what I heard it wasn't just a Seedling, it was one close to maturity.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000355|Well, I'm wondering why you're not asking me about the Seedling that disappeared the same night Askor was murdered.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000354|Did you hear anything else about Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000353|I'm guessing somewhere in the forest, or why ask me, right?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000352|Do you know where they found Askor's body?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000351|But, you know, people can be like that. Some value our work, others think they're superior some how.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000350|Not at all. I mean, I knew of him. People talked about him, but I don't think I ever said more than hello to him and he ignored me. He didn't really have time for Cultivators.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000349|How well did you know Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000348|Oh, then I was back in Goliet some time around then. I've lost track to be honest, but whenever it was I didn't see anything.|Remembering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000347|Three months ago. Around Mana's Eve.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000346|I only go back for supplies, or to transport Seedlings. When was Askor killed?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000345|Probably, I haven't been anywhere else in months.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000344|So, you were here when he was killed?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000343|Nothing really, I don't hear much from Goliet out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000342|Thanks for your help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000341|If I tried to attack a Warrior with a sword, chances are you'd be planting me in the ground.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000340|You're out here with a sword and no witnesses.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000339|You mean the Seedling he had? I'm a Cultivator. I look after a World Heart I want to know what happened to the Seedling he had! Why aren't you investigating where it went?|Stressing 'if'
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000338|You really don't think you have a motive?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000337|Me? Of course I didn't!|Surprised there was even a chance of that
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000336|I don't think you killed Askor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000335|Tell me, what do you know about Askor's murder?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000334|I'm a Hunter, you want to know where I am, I'm always here in the forest.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000333|Is that your only alibi?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000332|If you want an alibi for me you'll have to go out there and speak to the raptors.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000331|I'm questioning anyone I meet out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000330|What's with all these questions? Is some asshole trying to pin this on me?|Suspicious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000329|I think most people are assholes. You only asked me about Askor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000328|Sounds like you had a grudge.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000327|I didn't put myself in a position where I needed to. Little shit won't be missed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000326|You didn't like Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000325|Sociable just means happy to talk shit. I don't talk shit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000324|Sociable guy aren't you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000323|This is the best area for hunting and all Goliet cares about is me filling my quota. As long as I send them meat and fur, I can stay out here away from small talk and politics.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000322|I don't know, not for a year.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000321|When were you last in the forest by Goliet?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000320|I kept out of his way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000319|Yeah, I knew him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000318|He kissed Ragnar's ass and treated everyone else like rotboar shit.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000317|That asshole?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000316|I'm here to feed Berserkers, not the creatures.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000315|A bow, traps...you should always try and kill at a distance. Learn that and you will live longer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000314|Do you always hunt with a bow?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000313|Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000312|I've heard enough.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000311|The Berserker who was murdered was called Askor. Did you know him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000310|The forest is a dangerous place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000309|A Berserker was killed. The body was found in the forest.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000308|They're missing good meat.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000307|You won't catch anyone in Goliet roasting a rotboar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000306|Whatever I find. You can't be too picky if you want to hit Goliet's quota and feed yourself.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000305|What are you hunting?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000304|Why not?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000302|But, you look like a talker. Is that why you're here? To talk?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000301|Too much talking. Too much bullshit. Out here...peace.|Pausing in the middle to demonstrate the quiet
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000300|This is where I belong. With nature and for nature. I want nothing to do with Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000299|Yes, I've found my place.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000298|What do you have to trade?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000297|You are a Hunter?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000296|You're scaring away the prey that is my livelihood.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000295|Why's that your business?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000294|I don't know these forests.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000293|Hey you! What are you doing? You're scaring away everything within a day's walk!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000292|Not now. Let's talk later.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000291|He was reliable, but he seems to have lost heart in himself. There's something troubling him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000290|Because, it sounds like you're doing something about this. Like you want to find out who did it.|Defensive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000289|Maybe. And?|Hangdog
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000288|You look quite strong for somebody who's just standing around all day.|Sceptical
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000287|All Berserkers are. You think I could survive out here if I couldn't use it?|Matter of fact
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000286|Have you been trained to use that sword?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000285|There is quite the view of the Valley there. It's a good place to let your worries just...drift away.|Wistful
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000284|The lift into the Valley of the Damned. That's a good place to relax.|Wistful
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000283|Nearby. Not Goliet if that's what you mean? I tend to stay out here these days.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000282|And I'm glad I didn't see him. I wouldn't want to remember him like that.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000281|No. I know where he was found, but no, I didn't.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000279|Askor's body was found near here, did you see it?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000278|Our parents were friends, we grew up like brothers.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000277|Since we were old enough to crawl.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000276|Did you know Askor well?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000275|They're the trees over there. They're my girls.|Recalling the list
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000274|It's very lonely out here. So no, I have no alibi.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000273|Hilda, she was with me all night. Her and Alva. And Dagny, And Erika, Freja, Gerd, Hege, Magnhild...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000272|Did anyone see you, is there anyone who can give you an alibi?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000271|I was out here at the time. On guard duty.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000270|Me? I only know what people are saying. That they thought Askor had run away. But, he hadn't, he'd been murdered somewhere out in the forest. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000269|Tell me what you do know about the murder.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000267|You should start with people who had a problem with him, not his friends.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000266|Why would I kill him!? He was my friend!|Amazed he is being accused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000265|Why should I believe you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000264|You knew him, you don't have an alibi...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000263|Ambition only gets you dead. He should've picked his spot and stayed there.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000262|Not anything that's not being said already.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000261|He should've kept his head down like me.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000260|Maybe you did it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000259|I hope you find who did it.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000258|That's all the questions I have.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000257|I can't tell you anything about that.|Sad
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000256|I need to ask you about Askor's murder.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000255|And, it's not like these trees do much. I mean, they're not going to run away while I'm asleep are they?|Defensive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000254|You're lucky I'm not an enemy.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000253|Leave me alone will you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000252|Did Master Thorald send you? Is there something important? Because if not, just go, ok?|Nervously getting into his role as a guard
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000251|Stop asking questions and answer them, who are you?|Nervous
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000250|Are you a guard?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000249|Huh, what? Ah, who are you? What do you want? Who goes there?|Waking - the animation will have him get up separately and then the line will start with him standing, so we can flavour the line with sleepy, but not go into big yawns etc
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000248|Nothing to do?|Waking the sleeping Barin
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000247|You should go to the camp in Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000246|Follow me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000245|Stay here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000244|You lead, I'll follow.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000243|Then let's go.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000242|I'll deal with any trouble.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000241|Then you have it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000240|I could use your help.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000239|I didn't think he would have had the opportunity, but Ragnar insisted I look into him. I guess Ragnar was wrong.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000238|I'd say he didn't kill Askor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000237|Rock wasn't anywhere near Goliet when the murder was committed. He didn't like Askor, but I don't think he could've done it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000236|Yes, I agree, I don't think Irdor was capable of this. That's one less suspect for us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000235|Besides, he is just too weak to have killed Askor in the way you described.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000234|Irdor didn't have time to commit a murder, he's tending to the World Heart and looking after supplies.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000233|I agree. I don't think it was him either. Let's take him off the list.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000232|It's not conclusive, but I don't think it was him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000231|Yeah, all Geron wants is to hunt. He'd have no motive for this.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000230|Besides, if he had killed Askor he'd have used his bow, not a sword.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000229|Geron just wants to hunt. He didn't like Askor, but I don't think he killed him.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000228|You're making good progress. I'll keep Ragnar informed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000227|He's also too skilled a fighter to have left Askor such a bloody mess. So, he's out as a suspect.|Agreeing
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000226|And, he has witnesses to prove it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000225|Thorgal wasn't anywhere near Goliet at the time of the murder.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000224|Let's take him off the list for now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000223|Frankly, I only think Ragnar wanted Barin questioned in case he had seen anything. It looks like he didn't.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000222|All right, even though he knew Askor better than most, you're right. He doesn't have the energy, or the motive.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000221|And, Barin just wants to be left alone. I don't see why he'd murder anyone.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000220|Askor was his friend.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000219|I don't think Barin did it.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000218|It's Ragnar we will have to convince, he is certain one of them did it. He's not often wrong. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000217|You were right, the investigation was a waste of time. It must've been someone outside Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000216|All of his suspects are innocent. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000215|About Askor's murder...|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000214|Let me know if you need help. Remember, my sword belongs to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000213|Tell them you're investigating on Ragnar's orders.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000212|They'll answer your questions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000211|Will the suspects talk to me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000210|They're all still out there. Track them down then report back to me when you have discovered something.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000209|Where can I find them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000208|I doubt you'll get a confession, I doubt any of them did it, but you'll get a sense of the men and then you can report back to me so we can close the case.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000207|Where they were three months ago around Mana's Eve when the crime was committed? What they thought of Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000206|What do you want me to ask them?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000205|They were all outside Goliet at the time of the murder.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000204|Rock I can't get a handle on, there's something he's not happy about. Irdor is still wet behind the ears, bit of a whiner, but seems to care about his job.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000203|Last are Irdor and Rock.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000202|Third is Geron, a hunter.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000201|I have no idea why Ragnar would put him on the list, maybe just to be complete.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000200|Then there's Thorgal. He's in charge of a World Heart in Abessa.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000199|As far as I know he doesn't have an alibi, but I think the only real reason he's on the list is because he knew Askor when he was younger.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000198|First on the list is Barin. He's a guard, well he's supposed to be a guard.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000197|A group of people who were out in the forest at the time of the murder.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000196|To do your dirty work?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000195|But, if a Warlord has an itch to scratch then that means we have go and scratch it. So, let's cross all these suspects off the list and give him some closure.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000194|I brought you to Goliet to give you a chance. And this is a way to earn it by getting a Warlord on your side.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000193|Is this why you brought me to Goliet?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000192|Me, I think it's a wild goose chase. None of Ragnar's questioning has thrown up any proof a Berserker was involved in this, so chances are it was an Alb, an Outlaw, or a Reaver.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000191|But, Ragnar, against all the evidence, seems to think it was a Berserker that killed Askor and he wants answers.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000190|Look, to be honest, I think this is a dead end job.|Admission
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000189|What kind of logic is that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000188|You're a stranger here, that means you might see things I won't.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000187|And you think I can find the killer?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000186|Who are the suspects?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000185|No idea, why these five exactly, but Ragnar will have his reasons.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000184|So, Ragnar drew up a list of five suspects.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000183|But, if Ragnar's right, then it must be someone who was outside the walls at the time of the crime.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000182|Askor was killed with a sword and there aren't too many people who use swords outside of Edan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000181|They didn't find anything on Askor to point to who might be the murderer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000180|It looks like he was stabbed several times with a sword. Whoever did it was strong enough to overcome him, but clumsy.|He's using clumsy as a way of hiding the truth, that he, a skilled warrior did it.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000179|Then one of Ragnar's patrols found Askor's body rotting out in the forest.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000178|He went missing around Mana's Eve three months ago. No one knew where he'd gone. And it wasn't like he had many shards to up and disappear with.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000177|His name was Askor. He was a Warrior, newly promoted from Cultivator. Ragnar had high hopes for him, but Askor wasn't...popular.|Dodging the fact that Duras and others think Askor was an asshole.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000176|And who knows? Maybe one of them did do it and you'll get the proof.|Resigned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000175|Myself, I don't know if we'll ever know what happened. But, if we can eliminate these five suspects he might let this go.|Resigned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000174|Ragnar wants answers, he seems determined to find out what happened.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000173|I'll find the murderer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000172|Does Ragnar think a Berserker murdered Askor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000171|Tell me about the victim.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000169|Well, I'm having trouble getting answers from people. Maybe an outsider will have more success getting them to open up. Would you talk to the suspects and see what they have to say?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000168|And what can I do?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000167|There's been an investigation, but no definitive answers as to why he was killed, so Ragnar wants me to follow up and find the murderer.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000166|You see, there was a murder committed just outside Goliet a few months ago. A rather dedicated Berserker called Askor was killed.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000165|Well, the task I have on offer should profit you and, though it's not the best way to sell our community to you, it should demonstrate that we're open about things here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000164|Tell me about the job.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000163|Listen, I'm not sure if I want to stay.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000162|Well, I've been given a job by Warlord Ragnar that I think might suit you, if you want to stay around for longer?|businesslike
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000161|So, you decided to stick around?|Pleased to see the player character.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000159|You're an idiot if you think the Separatists can help you!|cold minus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000158|But, for now, the Separatists are outnumbered, without friends and defiant. They're already finding  life is hard out here if you haven't joined one of the factions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000157|You should try and get a better weapon and some armor before heading into the wastelands, but it's up to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000154|But, I'm sure that together, we can defeat the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000152|You should not trust traitors.|cold plus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000151|They try and kill us, so we kill them. Except the Separatists, a group of Albs that has broken away from Xacor. Maybe, they could be allies.|Albs is either related to the player's admission, or Duras's suspicion that the player character could be an Alb.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000150|What happens if you find an Alb here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000149|Have a look around our community. See what we can offer you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000148|So, I can just leave whenever I want?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000147|You can find supplies and get yourself back on your feet in Goliet and then... the choice will be yours.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000146|Look for me once you've settled in. You'll find me up at Warlord Ragnar's stronghold at the top of Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000145|Well, we have reached Goliet, but this is only the start of your journey.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000143|You should be able to make your way on alone from here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000142|And it does seem like there are some Clerics who want to repeat those mistakes and take us back into open warfare.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000141|All the factions come here. For intel, for resources. We all take from each other.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000140|There have been wars in the past.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000139|At least it's just raids from the Clerics for now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000138|Do you often find Clerics in Edan?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000137|Those Clerics should be around here somewhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000136|Irrelevant? It's where we all came from. The Berserkers want to grow the world back to what it was. The other factions pick through its bones hoping to find the technology it left us.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000135|Ruins and wreckage. The Old World is irrelevant.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000134|Only what I've learned on my travels.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000133|You know about the Old World?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000132|These ruins look like they were some sort of machine shop in the Old World.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000131|Opportunities are there to be seized.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000130|A brave choice.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000129|Let's go into the ruins.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000128|Right. Follow me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000127|Let's go on to Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000126|It would definitely be safer to bypass them for now.|Duras wants the player to choose to go into the ruins
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000125|But, there's a risk to that. So, maybe we should just head straight for Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000124|I'd better warn you that the creatures in there won't take prisoners.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000123|That's up to you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000122|You want us to go into the ruins?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000120|I cannot decide whether to join a faction out here. Let's go on.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000114|Well, we have a choice to make. You are short of equipment. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000113|I have no interest in factions.|Wary, cold plus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000112|Stop questioning me about my business, or I'll get angry!|Honest, cold minus one.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000109|Why haven't you joined a faction?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000108|Checked on the enemy? Yes... maybe you're right. We're all allies in the fight against the Albs.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000107|I wish more people would look for common ground instead of shouting our differences.|Resigned
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000106|Concern for an enemy? You're right, no one deserves that death.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000105|Well, you'll find many that agree with you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000104|Maybe they're alive. Haven't you checked? |Concerned, humane
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000103|Eaten by Rotboars? That is no death for a warrior.|Curious, humane cold minus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000102|The only good enemy is a dead enemy. Those Rotboars saved you a job.|cold plus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000101|Instead they ran into a group of Rotboars, got chased into those ruins and haven't come out.|Edge of sympathy for the clerics
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000100|Well, that was their plan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000099|Maybe, maybe... A group of Clerics came through this area a few days ago. A scouting party reconnoitering Goliet.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000098|Can we find anything useful there?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000097|Remnants of the Old World. A reminder that the past can be left behind.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000096|What are the ruins over there?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000095|And, that's bad news for us all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000094|It feels like something serious is brewing up there in Xacor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000093|Well, apart from the scouting party on the edge of the forest.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000092|The raider crashed a week ago. It's been quiet since then.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000091|You say there were Albs in this area? How long ago was that?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000090|All right, then follow me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000089|Let's keep going.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000088|We should move on. One down side of all this plant life is that you can't see the Rotboars coming.|Pushing the player to move on.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000087|They need more people. And they offer anyone who comes the same chance to start over.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000086|But, the Berserkers are using their magic to bring our world back to life. Just look around you. Edan is the greenest place on Magalan.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000085|A living breathing planet turned to ash and dust.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000084|Magalan almost died when the Comet hit.|Aware that they're talking in dangerous territory
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000083|If it's so dangerous, why do you come out here?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000082|If I want answers I need to find him. And, for that...I'll need weapons and equipment.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000081|I'm here in enemy territory. What was Kallax doing here so far from Xacor?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000080|I've never come through this area once without getting attacked.|Warning
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000079|Okay, watch your step.|Cautious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000078|Sure, you'll get given orders and you'll have to follow the Law, but it's not like you have things easy out here.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000076|That's what I do after all.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000075|Then you you can go. You can only join one faction, but... there will always be ways to explore the world.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000074|And neither of us want to end up as Rotboar food.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000073|Keep your eyes open. We're entering the hunting grounds of some of the local wildlife.|Warning
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000072|Very well. And keep up!|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000071|Just lead the way.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000070|Oh, and the name's Duras. Pleased to meet you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000069|Just look for the light from our Mana shrine. You can see that from a good distance away.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000068|Then follow me. And if we lose each other for any reason, you'll find Goliet to the east, at the foot of the mountain.|Positive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000067|Lead the way.|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000066|I will come with you to Goliet.|Wary
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000065|What if I decided to leave?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000064|Your actions and words seem to match. I will trust you for now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000063|So, what's it going to be? Are you going to stay here, or come with me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000062|And you just take people in?|Dismissive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000061|You'll train me and give me equipment?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000059|If you stay, you'll have to earn you place. But, be you Cleric, Outlaw, or Alb - that's true everywhere.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000058|Look, we can keep talking, but at some point you've got to decide.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000056|Follow me to Goliet and you can earn the Elexit to buy armor and supplies. Trust me, you'll need them.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000054|We should get going. This is Rotboar territory and you won't last long if a pack of them turn up here. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000053|Warriors, Cultivators, hunters, storekeepers, whatever your skills we can find a place for you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000051|Like I said, Goliet needs people. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000050|Why do you want to help me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000049|But, I wouldn't rush after him, he's probably sold your armor by now.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000048|I don't know. He disappeared off to the northeast. I'm guessing he went back into Tavar.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000047|Where do I find him?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000046|Well, for anything stolen near here recently I would start with Ray. He's an Outlaw I found out here a few days ago. Very jumpy, definitely looking for something.|Considering
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000045|I want to find the thief who took my armor.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000044|Instead, you'll get a chance to prove yourself. To join us.|Sarcastic
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000043|You won't see the inside of a Converter with us to protect you. |
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000042|Just take a look at yourself. No armor, no weapons, no companions.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000041|It sounds like you've been brainwashed!|humane cold minus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000040|Well, all that changes today. Whatever you've done before, your life can start again. A new beginning.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000039|You've not exactly succeeded in life have you?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000038|Every choice you make adds up in this world. The way you speak to people will determine your course in life.|Calm observation, persuasive
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000037|What you say is logical.|cold plus one
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000036|If you want a chance to survive, it's the best offer you'll get.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000035|And what have you got to lose right now? Nothing from what I can see.|Fishing, half suspects the truth about the player character - that he is an Alb
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000034|That's why I joined the Berserkers. Out here, drifting and hoping to stay alive. I knew it was only a matter of time before my luck ran out.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000033|Ha, I guess you're right. Still, I reckon you'd've mentioned if there was anyone else still up there, seeing as you're looking for people yourself.|Irritated
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000032|You said not to trust anyone, so why trust my answer?|Lying
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000031|You can save yourself the effort, there's no one up there.|Lying, wary of his true identity (an Alb) being discovered.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000030|But, you're welcome to stay and risk being picked up by an Alb raiding party. Between them and the Rotboars...  you won't live long. |Calm
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000029|I want this war to be over. Until then Goliet needs more people to survive. And people need a safe place to go. Well, a safer place than being out here on your own.|Reasonable.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000027|What is you really want?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000026|You could be some kind of slaver.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000025|Safe?|Suspicious
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000024|That's my job. I look for people out here and help them reach Goliet. You'll be safe there.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000023|Why would you help me?|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000022|Come on, get up.|Amused
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000021|I'd better move, before they come back to finish the job.|Realising the danger
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000020|And, I'd better find a weapon.|Pained, urgent
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000019|I should be dead....|Pained, recovering.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000013|Only facts matter, not words.|He likes the truth
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000012|Prove you're not the thief, and I might trust you.|Still tense
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000011|And I don't trust anyone, especially not you.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000010|I don't apologize for nothing, asshole.|Angry
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000008|Which means you just got very, very lucky. I can help you find a safe place and new equipment. If you stop trying to attack me.|
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000007|Hmmm, trusting people quickly out here is as good a way to get killed as walking round without a decent weapon.      |Defusing the tension, calming
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000006|If I wanted you dead, we wouldn't be having this conversation, trust me. You need to apologize.|Calm, controlled. Stern
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000004|First you attack me, then you accuse me of being a thief and a murderer?|Amused. Calm explanation
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000003|Then I find you here waiting to finish the job.|Tense
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000002|Someone tried to kill me. They stole my armor and my equipment.|This is the first person the player has met since the attempted execution. He is tense wary of who this person might be.
INFO_PANKRATZI7_00000001|If you're going to make a habit of attacking people without warning, you should get better at it. I heard you before you even left the ruins.|Amused, he's just defeated the player in combat in unarmed combat and is feeling confident. He's weighing the player up as he cautions him
